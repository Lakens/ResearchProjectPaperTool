You need an OpenAI key with balance on it to make the model work.
Make an OpenAI account at and then access https://platform.openai.com/api-keys to make the key.
NOTE! This key will only be shown to you ONCE and it should remain SECRET, it is directly linked to your balance.
Every time you initialize a prompt or perform some embedding this will use up tokens and subtract money from your account.

You must have a document 'constants.py', in this file you write the following line:
APIKEY = "ADD_YOUR_API_KEY"
