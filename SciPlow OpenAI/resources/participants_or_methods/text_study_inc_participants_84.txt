Participants
Forty-six people (34 men and 12 women) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th Edition (DSM IV) criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 1994 ) were included.
Diagnoses were determined by using chart information to check whether DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia were met and were confi rmed by independent on-site psychiatrists.
Exclusion criteria were the existence of comorbid neurological pathology and intelligence quotient (IQ) score <70 (which is considered the upper border of mental retardation).
Patients' mean age was 27.4 ( SD = 7.7) years.
A scale (Verhage, 1983 ) ranging from 1 = primary school (6 years of formal education) to 7 = university (16 years of formal education) was used to classify the level of education; the mean level of education was 4.8 ( SD = 0.9).
In this sample, the mean number of psychotic episodes was 2.1 (range 1-10, SD = 2.0), the mean duration of illness was 7 ( SD = 8.5) years, and the mean age of onset was 24.2 ( SD = 5.1) years.
Four patients did not use antipsychotic medication at the time of assessment, being fi rstepisode patients not yet prescribed medication.
One patient used classic antipsychotic medication (haloperidol) and 41 patients used atypical antipsychotic medication (aripiprazol, n = 5; clozapine, n = 8; olanzapine, n = 12; quetiapine, n = 1; and risperidone, n = 15).
Fifteen patients were living independently, of whom nine received outpatient care and six participated in a rehabilitation program (Withaar & Arends, 2002 ).
Twenty-seven patients lived temporarily in houses provided by the institution to facilitate participation in a rehabilitation program.
One patient lived in a sheltered home.
The remaining 3 patients were inpatients.
A group of 53 healthy controls (24 men and 29 women) was also included.
Exclusion criteria were a history of psychiatric disorders, comorbid neurological pathology, and IQ <70.
Patients' mean age was 31.1 (range 18-53, SD 10.2) years, and mean education level was 6 ( SD = 0.6).
