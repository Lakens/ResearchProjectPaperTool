Participants
Participating in the study were 426 students who attended one of two selected schools (one middle school and one high school) in a rural, relatively poor county of a southeastern state.
The average age of subjects was 15 (range 10-21, SD = 2.18).
The sample was split evenly between males and females.
Non-Hispanic whites were the most represented racial/ethnic group (66% of the sample); 11% of the sample was African-American and 13% Hispanic or Latino.
Additionally, family disruption was common in the sample-only 50% of subjects reported living in a household with both their mother and father.
