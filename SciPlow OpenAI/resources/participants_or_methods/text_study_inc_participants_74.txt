Participants
Twenty-three schizophrenic patients (18 males, 5 females) with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) who were treated as in-patients or attended a day clinic and who had given informed consent to participate were included.
All patients received antipsychotic medication.
Patients' mean age at onset of the disorder was 26.5 years (12-59 years; S.D.F10 years), and their mean duration of illness was 12.3 years (0-35 years; S.D.F7.9 years).
Eighteen healthy control subjects (8 males, 10 females) with no history of psychiatric disorders were recruited from the community and in part from hospital staff (nurses, technicians, and secretaries).
Patients and control group were paralleled for dcrystallizedT verbal intelligence as measured by the dMehrfachwahlwortschatztestT (MWT; which may best be translated as dMultiple Choice Verbal Comprehension TestT; Lehrl, 1976), and for age.
English readership may note that the German MWT is similar to the widely used dSpot-the-Word TestT (Baddeley et al., 1993).
Demographic characteristics of the participants, including ratings of psychopathology and social behavior in the patient group, are shown in Table 1.
