Methods
Subject and instrument The subjects for this study were randomly selected from three middle schools in a large city in Canada. A total of 264 grade 7-9 students (130 males and 134 females) completed the questionnaire. Among them, only 5.8 percent were ESL students. Further, 75.4 percent of the students were white, 6.4 percent Asian, and about 18 percent were Black, Hispanic, Aboriginal or from other ethic groups (see Table 1 for details). Over half of the students reported above average school grades, while close to 40 percent of them reported average grades. Only a couple of the students reported below average grades. An anonymous survey adapted from previous research (Li, in press) was used which includes two major areas: students' demographic data and their experience related to cyberbullying. A total of 26 questions including the frequency of using computers were analysed to answer the research questions of this study (see Appendix 1 for details of the survey). School Psychology International (2006), Vol. 27(2) Analysis Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to examine gender differences in junior high students' experience of cyberbullying. The statistical package SPSS ( 2004) was used to analyse data. Descriptive statistics were employed to provide background information such as the extent and frequencies of cyberbullying. Further, chi-square tests were used with an alpha level of 0.05 to examine possible gender differences.
