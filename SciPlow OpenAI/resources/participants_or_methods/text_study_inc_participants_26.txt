Participants
Middle and high school-aged students from the Lower Mainland of British Columbia were invited to participate in this study.
The final sample for the questionnaire portion of the study was 733 (454 females; 255 males).
Participants ranged in age from ten to eighteen (M = 15) and were in grades 5-12.
In terms of ethnicity, 45% of the participants were of East Asian descent (e.g.
Cambodian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Filipino), whereas 34% were of European descent.
The remaining ethnic groups, comprising approximately 2% of the sample each, included Aboriginal, African/Caribbean, South Asian, Latin American, Middle Eastern, and mixed background.
A large majority of the students (81%) had access to high speed Internet at home, and approximately 60% of participants had their own cell phone.
