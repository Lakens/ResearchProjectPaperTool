Participants
Of the 168 people who made inquiries, five (3.0%) were interested but not eligible based on the exclusion criteria and 26 (15.5%) were eligible but chose not to participate for other reasons, most commonly an inability to make the time commitment.
The remaining 137 (81.5%) patients were enrolled and randomized to one of the writing groups.
Of these patients, 20 (14.6%) dropped out between enrollment and the first session; 14 cited scheduling problems or lack of time, two unexpectedly moved from the area, three chose not to participate after receiving the initial assessment packet, and one person was lost to contact.
Of the 117 patients who attended to the first session, three failed to complete the study.
No significant association was found between group assignment or gender and withdrawal from the study after randomization.
This left 114 participants who completed the study, 83% of those initially randomized.
All subsequent descriptive statistics and analyses refer to this group of completers, although all analyses were also conducted with the intent-to-treat sample (baseline carried forward) and yielded substantively identical results.
Figure 1 summarizes the general flow of participants in and out of the study.
