Participants
Twenty-six outpatients at the University of Chicago, Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation (UCCPR) participated in the study. All subjects met criteria for schizophrenia based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Patient version (SCID-P; Spitzer et al., 1995) and a chart review. The SCID-P was administered by research assistants who had been trained to a kappa of at least 0.70 with consensus criteria from the UC-CPR. Subjects were excluded from participation if they had a chart history of neurological disorder or developmental disability, corrected vision of less than 20/30 on the Snellen Eye Chart, less than a third-grade reading level as measured by the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT), and evidence of substance abuse in the past 6 months determined from the SCID-P.

The participants in the study had a mean age of 33.4 years (SD = 9.7), had been previously hospitalized an average of 4.8 times (SD = 3.8), had a mean educational level of 12.1 years (SD = 1.8), and had an average score of 49.5 on the WRAT (SD = 12.8, N = 23; WRAT scores were unavailable for three subjects). Males and females accounted for 57.6% and 42.4% of the sample, respectively. Sixty-five percent of the sample was African-American, and 35% were Caucasian. Finally, all subjects received antipsychotic medication with an average daily dosage chlorpromazine (CPZ) equivalent of 698 mg (SD = 513.65). The neuroleptic dosage level was unavailable for one subject. Thus, this subject was excluded from the computation of the average neuroleptic level for study participants.
