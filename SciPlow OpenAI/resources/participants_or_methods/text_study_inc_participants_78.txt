Participants
Twenty schizophrenia patients were recruited from a local residential mental health care facility.
The schizophrenia patients had a mean age of 39.3 (S.D.s8.5) and a mean education of 12.7 years (S.D.s2.9).
Patients had an average duration of illness of approximately 18.8 years (S.D.s10.2).
There were 15 males and 5 females in our sample.
Fifteen of the patients were Caucasian.
All of the patients were taking antipsychotic medication at the time of testing with a mean chlorpromazine equivalent dose of approximately 1043 mg.
Advanced clinical graduate students under the supervision of a licensed psychologist diagnosed schizophrenia patients according to DSM-IV criteria.
Information about the patient's illness was acquired through the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS) interview and medical chart reviews (Endicott and Spitzer, 1978).
Exclusion criteria were comorbid Axis I disorders, neurological disorders, substance abuse, history of severe head injury, or over 55 years of age.
Twenty-seven normal control participants were recruited via postings in the community.
There were 14 males and 13 females in our sample.
Nineteen of the participants were Caucasian.
The mean age of the normal participants was 34.4 (S.D.s8.3), and they had a mean level of education of 13.6 years (S.D.s1.8).
Participants were screened for history of psychiatric disturbance, substance abuse, neurological disorders, possible schizotypal personality wi.e. scoring above 45 on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (Raine, 1991)x.
Schizophrenia patients were slightly older than the normal control participants, but the age difference was not significant (F s3.8, P)
1, 45 0.05).
There was no significant difference in years of education (F s1.6, P)0.1) between the 1, 45 two groups.
All participants gave informed consent and were paid for their participation.
