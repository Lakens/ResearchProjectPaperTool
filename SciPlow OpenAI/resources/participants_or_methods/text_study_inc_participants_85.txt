Participants
Twenty-five healthy controls (10 males) with a mean age of 35.7 years (SD = 12.9) were recruited from the general community.
Thirty clinical participants (17 males) with a mean age of 46.1 years (SD = 8.4) were recruited from an outpatient clinic in the South Eastern Sydney and Illawarra Area Health Service, and the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank Register (ASRB Register).
Twenty-seven participants met DSM-IV (A.P.A., 1994) criteria for schizophrenia, and 3 met criteria for schizoaffective disorder.
Two schizophrenia participants completed less than 70% of the test battery due to fatigue, and were therefore excluded from analyses.
The twenty-eight remaining clinical outpatient participants (16 males) had a mean age of 45.9 years (SD = 8.7).
All were taking antipsychotic medication at the time of testing: 4 participants were using conventional antipsychotics (clopixol) and 23 were taking second-generation atypicals (clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone).
Inclusion criteria were age 18-65 years, and ability to speak fluent English, with more than 10 years of formal education.
Exclusion criteria were history of head trauma, a neurological illness or central nervous system infection causing brain injury, or current alcohol or substance abuse or dependence.
