Participants
Participants were undergraduate students at a large, urban university.
The recruitment procedure for this study was identical to the procedure used in our earlier study (see Sloan & Marx's, 2004a, study for a detailed description of recruitment procedure).
Of the 96 participants contacted for this study, 81 (59 women, 22 men) were eligible and willing to participate.
Two participants failed to return for follow-up assessment.
The remaining 79 participants (59 women, 20 men) completed the entire study, including both follow-up periods.
These 79 participants were included in subsequent data analyses.
The participants in the study were ethnically or racially diverse (45 were White and not of Hispanic origin, 23 were African American, 3 were Hispanic, 6 were Asian American, and 2 were of a mixed racial background) and had a mean age of 19.0 years (SD ϭ 1.6 years).
As is typical for many individuals who have experienced a traumatic event (McFarlane & de Girolamo, 1996), 76% (n ϭ 60) of all participants reported experiencing more than one traumatic event.
A fairly large percentage of the group reported that they had been in psychotherapy in the past (42%, n ϭ 33) and/or had taken psychotropic medication in the past (37%, n ϭ 29), with the majority of participants reporting poor to fair response.
