Method Participants. Ninety-four clinically stabilized outpatients (63 men, 31 women) of five community-based psychosocial rehabilitation services in Los Angeles were recruited from a larger study investigating neuropsychological and psychophysiological factors as predictors of psychosocial rehabilitation outcome (J.S. Brekke, PL, and M.F. Green, Co-P.L). All five rehabilitation programs have rich clientto-staff ratios and similar psychosocial rehabilitation ideologies, including comprehensive and service-intensive rehabilitative environments that combine a consumer-oriented philosophy with a high push for increased functioning in the areas of social, vocational, and independent living. Informed consent was obtained from each subject using both written materials and verbal description. The mean age of the subjects was 38.7 years (standard deviation [SD] = 9.8), and the mean level of education was 12.1 years (SD = 1.8). Forty-six patients were Caucasian, 27 were African-American, 14 were Latino, and 7 were Asian or other. The mean duration of illness was 13.6 years (SD = 10.4). Of the initial sample, partial data were obtained for 13 patients because these subjects either had missing data at the baseline assessment or dropped out before completion of retesting at 12 months. Hence, the complete sample size for the analyses was 81 (57 men, 24 women). All subjects met the criteria for either schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder based on the DSM-FV (American Psychiatric Association 1994) checklist procedure. The diagnoses were confirmed using chart information and reports from clinicians as well as on-site psychiatrists. Raters administering the diagnostic checklist were trained by the Diagnostic and Psychopathology Unit of the University of California, Los Angeles, Intervention Research Center (R.P. Liberman, P.I.)-Subjects were excluded if they had a history of substance use disorder in the past 6 months, had an identifiable neurological disorder, or were less than 18 or over 55 years of age. Eighty-four of the 94 patients were receiving antipsychotic medication at baseline (n = 40 for atypical; n = 44 for conventional). Of the group that received atypical medication, two patients had been switched to conventional and one had been taken off antipsychotic medications at 12 months. Sixteen patients who received conventional antipsychotics had been switched to atypical medications and two were taking no medication 1 year later. Of the patients who were unmedicated at baseline, three were receiving conventional and two were receiving atypical antipsychotic medication at 12 months. Measures and Procedure. Data were collected on three measures of perception of emotion, two psychosocial outcome measures, and psychiatric symptoms at baseline and again at 12 months following psychosocial rehabilitation. For each time point, subjects were tested in two separate sessions that were a median length of 15 days apart. Psychosocial functioning assessments (via face-to-face interviews with the subjects) and clinical ratings of symptoms were conducted in the first session, and measures of emotion perception were administered in the second. For each perception of emotion test, the outcome measure was the total number of correct responses. The tests were administered in the order described below. Psychosocial outcome measures. Psychosocial outcome was assessed using the Strauss and Carpenter Outcome Scale (SCOS; Strauss and Carpenter 1972). This scale contains four discrete dimensions, each of which was rated from 0 (most dysfunction) to 4 (least dysfunction). For the current study, the two dimensions most relevant to functional outcome were used: social contacts and useful employment. For example, useful employment in one's primary role, such as wage earner, student, or housewife, was rated as follows: 0 = no useful work; 1 = employed less than half of the time in the past 6 months; 2 = employed part-time or full-time about half of the time in the past 6 months; 3 = employed more than 3 months but less than continuously in the past 6 months; and 4 = employed continuously in the past 6 months. The Role Functioning Scale (RFS; McPheeters 1984) measures four major domains of subjects' functioning in everyday life: work productivity, independent living/selfcare, relationships with family and spouse, and relationships with friends, each rated on specific anchor points ranging from 1 (severely limited functioning) to 7 (optimal functioning). The RFS has sound psychometric properties (Goodman et al. 1993) and has been widely used in service outcome studies in schizophrenia (e.g., Green and Gracely 1987;Brekke et al. 1997;Brekke and Long 2000). Examples of anchor points for the family relationships component are as follows: 1 = no contact with any family members or severely deviant behaviors within family network; 4 = relationships that are often minimal and fluctuating in quality (contact once a month); and 7 = positive relationships with several family members and assertive contributions to these relationships. Clinical rating scales. Psychiatric symptoms, including psychotic exacerbations, were assessed using the 24-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; Ventura et al. 1993). This semistructured interview, with specific anchor points, required approximately 20 minutes to complete. Three scales were derived from the BPRS for use in statistical analyses, which included a measure of positive symptoms (sum of hallucinations and unusual thought content), the conceptual disorganization item, and an index of negative symptoms (sum of blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, and motor retardation). Perception of emotion tests. The Facial Emotion Identification Test (Kerr and Neale 1993) consists of 19 black-and-white still photographs depicting differing facial emotions presented on videotape. After each photograph, the subjects were asked to circle on an answer sheet which one of six emotions (i.e., happy, angry, afraid, sad, surprised, and ashamed) best described the emotion of the photograph. Definitions of these six emo-tions were presented in written form and read aloud to the subjects before testing. For the Voice Emotion Identification Test (Kerr and Neale 1993), subjects were presented 21 sentences of neutral content on audiotape (e.g., "Fish can jump out of the water," "He tossed the bread to the pigeons"). Each sentence was spoken aloud in such a manner as to convey one of the same six emotions used in the Facial Emotion Identification Test. The subjects listened to each sentence and then circled on an answer sheet which of the six emotions best described the speaker's tone of voice. The Videotape Affect Perception Test (Bellack et al. 1996) includes 30 brief scenes from movies and television. At the start of each scene, the subjects were told to attend to a particular character. After viewing each scene, the subjects then selected one of six emotions that best described what that character was feeling. Results Descriptive data from the measures of emotion perception, psychosocial outcome, and psychiatric symptoms at baseline and 12 months are displayed in table 1. Primary data analyses for the current study focused on two issues: (1) evaluating the cross-sectional relationship between perception of emotion variables and domains of functional outcome at baseline and 12 months, and (2) predicting the longitudinal effects of emotion perception factors (baseline) on the specific functional outcome domains over 12 months. In addition, subsequent analyses were conducted to evaluate the role of gender and symptomatology in the relationship between perception of emotion and psychosocial functioning. To address concerns about excessive type I error associated with multiple significance testing, we reduced the data and simplified interpretation using a principal components analysis. Unless otherwise noted, significance levels were 2-tailed. Data Reduction. To reduce data, we first summed the three measures of emotion perception (i.e., facial emotion, voice emotion, and affect perception) into a single measure of perception of emotion (maximum score = 70), as in our previous studies (Kee et al. 1998fc, 1998c. For the functional outcome data, we applied a principal components analysis with orthogonal varimax rotation to restrict the six dependent variables to a delimited number of identified primary outcome domains. Two factors had eigenvalues greater than 1 and accounted for 68.1 percent of the total variance. Factor loadings are listed in table 2. At both baseline and 12 months, the strongest loadings for the first factor were work productivity (RFS), useful employment (SCOS), and independent living/selfcare (RFS). Relationships with friends (RFS), social con-tacts (SCOS), and relationships with family and spouse (RFS) loaded on the second factor. Although the independent living/self-care variable also loaded on the second factor at 12 months, its highest loading was on the first factor at baseline. In the subsequent analyses, we used these two factors (factor 1 = work functioning/independent living and factor 2 = social functioning/family relationships) as the psychosocial outcome measures. Cross-Sectional Correlations. Figure 1 shows a series of Pearson product-moment correlations between emotion perception performance and domains of psychosocial outcome for data collected at baseline and 12 months. At baseline, patients' emotion perception performance was moderately correlated with work functioning/independent living (r = 0.36, p = 0.002) but not social functioning/family relationships. Similarly, at 12 months the only significant correlation was between emotion perception and the psychosocial domain of work functioning/independent living (r = 0.29, p -0.016), indicating that better occupational skills and more appropriate self-care were related to greater performance on the emotion perception tasks. Prediction of Longitudinal Relationships. Figure 1 also presents the cross-temporal correlations between baseline measures in one domain and 12 months measures in the other. Pearson product-moment correlations revealed only one significant association: between baseline perception of emotion and work functioning/independent living 12 months later (r = 0.41, p = 0.0004). The effect size was moderate, and the correlation was in the direction of greater baseline emotion perception performance predicting better later work functioning/independent living. Because the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between perception of emotion and work functioning/independent living outcome were similar, the results suggested good stability of these associations.

With the two-wave panel design in this study (0 and 12 months), we were able to further explore the directionality of causal effects for the relationship between perception of emotion and work functioning/independent living outcome. A causal analysis was not justified for the other psychosocial variables because they were not correlated with emotion perception performance. As recommended by Campbell and Kenny (1999), we used three different statistical methods. The first is the cross-lagged panel correlation analysis. This method, described in detail by Kenny (1979), is a long-standing and wellknown technique for uncovering simple causal relationships in a longitudinal context. Cross-lagged panel correlation examines directionality of causal relations between

All five rehabilitation programs have rich clientto-staff ratios and similar psychosocial rehabilitation ideologies, including comprehensive and service-intensive rehabilitative environments that combine a consumer-oriented philosophy with a high push for increased functioning in the areas of social, vocational, and independent living. Informed consent was obtained from each subject using both written materials and verbal description. The mean age of the subjects was 38.7 years (standard deviation [SD] = 9.8), and the mean level of education was 12.1 years (SD = 1.8). Forty-six patients were Caucasian, 27 were African-American, 14 were Latino, and 7 were Asian or other. The mean duration of illness was 13.6 years (SD = 10.4). Of the initial sample, partial data were obtained for 13 patients because these subjects either had missing data at the baseline assessment or dropped out before completion of retesting at 12 months. Hence, the complete sample size for the analyses was 81 (57 men, 24 women). All subjects met the criteria for either schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder based on the DSM-FV (American Psychiatric Association 1994) checklist procedure. The diagnoses were confirmed using chart information and reports from clinicians as well as on-site psychiatrists. Raters administering the diagnostic checklist were trained by the Diagnostic and Psychopathology Unit of the University of California, Los Angeles, Intervention Research Center (R.P. Liberman, P.I.)-Subjects were excluded if they had a history of substance use disorder in the past 6 months, had an identifiable neurological disorder, or were less than 18 or over 55 years of age. Eighty-four of the 94 patients were receiving antipsychotic medication at baseline (n = 40 for atypical; n = 44 for conventional). Of the group that received atypical medication, two patients had been switched to conventional and one had been taken off antipsychotic medications at 12 months. Sixteen patients who received conventional antipsychotics had been switched to atypical medications and two were taking no medication 1 year later. Of the patients who were unmedicated at baseline, three were receiving conventional and two were receiving atypical antipsychotic medication at 12 months. Measures and Procedure. Data were collected on three measures of perception of emotion, two psychosocial outcome measures, and psychiatric symptoms at baseline and again at 12 months following psychosocial rehabilitation. For each time point, subjects were tested in two separate sessions that were a median length of 15 days apart. Psychosocial functioning assessments (via face-to-face interviews with the subjects) and clinical ratings of symptoms were conducted in the first session, and measures of emotion perception were administered in the second. For each perception of emotion test, the outcome measure was the total number of correct responses. The tests were administered in the order described below. Psychosocial outcome measures. Psychosocial outcome was assessed using the Strauss and Carpenter Outcome Scale (SCOS; Strauss and Carpenter 1972). This scale contains four discrete dimensions, each of which was rated from 0 (most dysfunction) to 4 (least dysfunction). For the current study, the two dimensions most relevant to functional outcome were used: social contacts and useful employment. For example, useful employment in one's primary role, such as wage earner, student, or housewife, was rated as follows: 0 = no useful work; 1 = employed less than half of the time in the past 6 months; 2 = employed part-time or full-time about half of the time in the past 6 months; 3 = employed more than 3 months but less than continuously in the past 6 months; and 4 = employed continuously in the past 6 months. The Role Functioning Scale (RFS; McPheeters 1984) measures four major domains of subjects' functioning in everyday life: work productivity, independent living/selfcare, relationships with family and spouse, and relationships with friends, each rated on specific anchor points ranging from 1 (severely limited functioning) to 7 (optimal functioning). The RFS has sound psychometric properties (Goodman et al. 1993) and has been widely used in service outcome studies in schizophrenia (e.g., Green and Gracely 1987;Brekke et al. 1997;Brekke and Long 2000). Examples of anchor points for the family relationships component are as follows: 1 = no contact with any family members or severely deviant behaviors within family network; 4 = relationships that are often minimal and fluctuating in quality (contact once a month); and 7 = positive relationships with several family members and assertive contributions to these relationships. Clinical rating scales. Psychiatric symptoms, including psychotic exacerbations, were assessed using the 24-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; Ventura et al. 1993). This semistructured interview, with specific anchor points, required approximately 20 minutes to complete. Three scales were derived from the BPRS for use in statistical analyses, which included a measure of positive symptoms (sum of hallucinations and unusual thought content), the conceptual disorganization item, and an index of negative symptoms (sum of blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, and motor retardation). Perception of emotion tests. The Facial Emotion Identification Test (Kerr and Neale 1993) consists of 19 black-and-white still photographs depicting differing facial emotions presented on videotape. After each photograph, the subjects were asked to circle on an answer sheet which one of six emotions (i.e., happy, angry, afraid, sad, surprised, and ashamed) best described the emotion of the photograph. Definitions of these six emo-tions were presented in written form and read aloud to the subjects before testing. For the Voice Emotion Identification Test (Kerr and Neale 1993), subjects were presented 21 sentences of neutral content on audiotape (e.g., "Fish can jump out of the water," "He tossed the bread to the pigeons"). Each sentence was spoken aloud in such a manner as to convey one of the same six emotions used in the Facial Emotion Identification Test. The subjects listened to each sentence and then circled on an answer sheet which of the six emotions best described the speaker's tone of voice. The Videotape Affect Perception Test (Bellack et al. 1996) includes 30 brief scenes from movies and television. At the start of each scene, the subjects were told to attend to a particular character. After viewing each scene, the subjects then selected one of six emotions that best described what that character was feeling. Baseline outcome variables
Method Participants. Ninety-four clinically stabilized outpatients (63 men, 31 women) of five community-based psychosocial rehabilitation services in Los Angeles were recruited from a larger study investigating neuropsychological and psychophysiological factors as predictors of psychosocial rehabilitation outcome (J.S. Brekke, PL, and M.F. Green, Co-P.L). All five rehabilitation programs have rich clientto-staff ratios and similar psychosocial rehabilitation ideologies, including comprehensive and service-intensive rehabilitative environments that combine a consumer-oriented philosophy with a high push for increased functioning in the areas of social, vocational, and independent living. Informed consent was obtained from each subject using both written materials and verbal description. The mean age of the subjects was 38.7 years (standard deviation [SD] = 9.8), and the mean level of education was 12.1 years (SD = 1.8). Forty-six patients were Caucasian, 27 were African-American, 14 were Latino, and 7 were Asian or other. The mean duration of illness was 13.6 years (SD = 10.4). Of the initial sample, partial data were obtained for 13 patients because these subjects either had missing data at the baseline assessment or dropped out before completion of retesting at 12 months. Hence, the complete sample size for the analyses was 81 (57 men, 24 women). All subjects met the criteria for either schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder based on the DSM-FV (American Psychiatric Association 1994) checklist procedure. The diagnoses were confirmed using chart information and reports from clinicians as well as on-site psychiatrists. Raters administering the diagnostic checklist were trained by the Diagnostic and Psychopathology Unit of the University of California, Los Angeles, Intervention Research Center (R.P. Liberman, P.I.)-Subjects were excluded if they had a history of substance use disorder in the past 6 months, had an identifiable neurological disorder, or were less than 18 or over 55 years of age. Eighty-four of the 94 patients were receiving antipsychotic medication at baseline (n = 40 for atypical; n = 44 for conventional). Of the group that received atypical medication, two patients had been switched to conventional and one had been taken off antipsychotic medications at 12 months. Sixteen patients who received conventional antipsychotics had been switched to atypical medications and two were taking no medication 1 year later. Of the patients who were unmedicated at baseline, three were receiving conventional and two were receiving atypical antipsychotic medication at 12 months. Measures and Procedure. Data were collected on three measures of perception of emotion, two psychosocial outcome measures, and psychiatric symptoms at baseline and again at 12 months following psychosocial rehabilitation. For each time point, subjects were tested in two separate sessions that were a median length of 15 days apart. Psychosocial functioning assessments (via face-to-face interviews with the subjects) and clinical ratings of symptoms were conducted in the first session, and measures of emotion perception were administered in the second. For each perception of emotion test, the outcome measure was the total number of correct responses. The tests were administered in the order described below. Psychosocial outcome measures. Psychosocial outcome was assessed using the Strauss and Carpenter Outcome Scale (SCOS; Strauss and Carpenter 1972). This scale contains four discrete dimensions, each of which was rated from 0 (most dysfunction) to 4 (least dysfunction). For the current study, the two dimensions most relevant to functional outcome were used: social contacts and useful employment. For example, useful employment in one's primary role, such as wage earner, student, or housewife, was rated as follows: 0 = no useful work; 1 = employed less than half of the time in the past 6 months; 2 = employed part-time or full-time about half of the time in the past 6 months; 3 = employed more than 3 months but less than continuously in the past 6 months; and 4 = employed continuously in the past 6 months. The Role Functioning Scale (RFS; McPheeters 1984) measures four major domains of subjects' functioning in everyday life: work productivity, independent living/selfcare, relationships with family and spouse, and relationships with friends, each rated on specific anchor points ranging from 1 (severely limited functioning) to 7 (optimal functioning). The RFS has sound psychometric properties (Goodman et al. 1993) and has been widely used in service outcome studies in schizophrenia (e.g., Green and Gracely 1987;Brekke et al. 1997;Brekke and Long 2000).

Three scales were derived from the BPRS for use in statistical analyses, which included a measure of positive symptoms (sum of hallucinations and unusual thought content), the conceptual disorganization item, and an index of negative symptoms (sum of blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, and motor retardation). Perception of emotion tests. The Facial Emotion Identification Test (Kerr and Neale 1993) consists of 19 black-and-white still photographs depicting differing facial emotions presented on videotape. After each photograph, the subjects were asked to circle on an answer sheet which one of six emotions (i.e., happy, angry, afraid, sad, surprised, and ashamed) best described the emotion of the photograph. Definitions of these six emo-tions were presented in written form and read aloud to the subjects before testing. For the Voice Emotion Identification Test (Kerr and Neale 1993), subjects were presented 21 sentences of neutral content on audiotape (e.g., "Fish can jump out of the water," "He tossed the bread to the pigeons"). Each sentence was spoken aloud in such a manner as to convey one of the same six emotions used in the Facial Emotion Identification Test. The subjects listened to each sentence and then circled on an answer sheet which of the six emotions best described the speaker's tone of voice. The Videotape Affect Perception Test (Bellack et al. 1996) includes 30 brief scenes from movies and television. At the start of each scene, the subjects were told to attend to a particular character. After viewing each scene, the subjects then selected one of six emotions that best described what that character was feeling. Relationships with friends Baseline factor 1 0.17 two variables, using the "cross-lagged" correlations. These are the correlations between each measure at one time point (e.g., baseline) and the other measure at some later time. A finding that one of these cross-lagged correlations is significantly larger suggests that the direction of causality is from that baseline variable (or unmeasured variables associated with it) to the other. The significant test for this comparison uses a formula that takes autocorrelations and concurrent correlations into account. In our current data, the correlation between baseline perception of emotion and 12-month work functioning/independent living was significantly greater than the other cross-lag (baseline work functioning/independent living to 12-month perception of emotion), z = 195, p = 0.026 (1tailed). Although the cross-lagged panel correlation analysis provides a good test of spuriousness, its model of causation is limited (see Campbell and Kenny 1999 for a detailed discussion). The multiple regression approach developed by Rogosa (1980) has an explicit model of causal effects but poor estimation of spuriousness. Rogosa's model, applied to the current data, revealed a significant causal path from baseline perception of emotion to 12-month work functioning/independent living (t = 2.25, p = 0.028) but no causal effect from baseline work functioning/independent living to 12-month emotion perception (p = 0.276). Finally, as a check for regression artifacts, the data were reanalyzed using the little-known method of timereversed analysis (Kenny and Campbell 1984). This method is a reanalysis of the original data in which the temporal ordering is reversed (i.e., baseline data are used as the dependent measures and followup data as the predictors). Kenny and Campbell note that if presumed causal effects are actually artifacts of regression to the mean, the original and time-reversed analyses will yield similar "causal" paths. Thus, finding that the causal paths in the original and time-reversed analyses differ supports the hypothesis that the causal effects are not due to regression artifacts. The results of the time-reversed analysis (using baseline work functioning as the dependent measure and 12-month outcomes as the predictors) were markedly different from the original findings. The regression coefficient between presumed cause and effect was highly significant in the original analysis (beta = 0.024, standard error [SE] = 0.01, p = 0.015) and essentially nil in the time-reversed analysis (beta = 0.002, SE = 0.10, p = 0.86).
Method Participants. Ninety-four clinically stabilized outpatients (63 men, 31 women) of five community-based psychosocial rehabilitation services in Los Angeles were recruited from a larger study investigating neuropsychological and psychophysiological factors as predictors of psychosocial rehabilitation outcome (J.S. Brekke, PL, and M.F. Green, Co-P.L). All five rehabilitation programs have rich clientto-staff ratios and similar psychosocial rehabilitation ideologies, including comprehensive and service-intensive rehabilitative environments that combine a consumer-oriented philosophy with a high push for increased functioning in the areas of social, vocational, and independent living. Informed consent was obtained from each subject using both written materials and verbal description. The mean age of the subjects was 38.7 years (standard deviation [SD] = 9.8), and the mean level of education was 12.1 years (SD = 1.8). Forty-six patients were Caucasian, 27 were African-American, 14 were Latino, and 7 were Asian or other. The mean duration of illness was 13.6 years (SD = 10.4). Of the initial sample, partial data were obtained for 13 patients because these subjects either had missing data at the baseline assessment or dropped out before completion of retesting at 12 months. Hence, the complete sample size for the analyses was 81 (57 men, 24 women). All subjects met the criteria for either schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder based on the DSM-FV (American Psychiatric Association 1994) checklist procedure. The diagnoses were confirmed using chart information and reports from clinicians as well as on-site psychiatrists. Raters administering the diagnostic checklist were trained by the Diagnostic and Psychopathology Unit of the University of California, Los Angeles, Intervention Research Center (R.P. Liberman, P.I.)-Subjects were excluded if they had a history of substance use disorder in the past 6 months, had an identifiable neurological disorder, or were less than 18 or over 55 years of age. Eighty-four of the 94 patients were receiving antipsychotic medication at baseline (n = 40 for atypical; n = 44 for conventional). Of the group that received atypical medication, two patients had been switched to conventional and one had been taken off antipsychotic medications at 12 months. Sixteen patients who received conventional antipsychotics had been switched to atypical medications and two were taking no medication 1 year later. Of the patients who were unmedicated at baseline, three were receiving conventional and two were receiving atypical antipsychotic medication at 12 months. Measures and Procedure. Data were collected on three measures of perception of emotion, two psychosocial outcome measures, and psychiatric symptoms at baseline and again at 12 months following psychosocial rehabilitation. For each time point, subjects were tested in two separate sessions that were a median length of 15 days apart. Psychosocial functioning assessments (via face-to-face interviews with the subjects) and clinical ratings of symptoms were conducted in the first session, and measures of emotion perception were administered in the second. For each perception of emotion test, the outcome measure was the total number of correct responses. The tests were administered in the order described below. Psychosocial outcome measures. Psychosocial outcome was assessed using the Strauss and Carpenter Outcome Scale (SCOS; Strauss and Carpenter 1972). This scale contains four discrete dimensions, each of which was rated from 0 (most dysfunction) to 4 (least dysfunction). For the current study, the two dimensions most relevant to functional outcome were used: social contacts and useful employment. For example, useful employment in one's primary role, such as wage earner, student, or housewife, was rated as follows: 0 = no useful work; 1 = employed less than half of the time in the past 6 months; 2 = employed part-time or full-time about half of the time in the past 6 months; 3 = employed more than 3 months but less than continuously in the past 6 months; and 4 = employed continuously in the past 6 months. The Role Functioning Scale (RFS; McPheeters 1984) measures four major domains of subjects' functioning in everyday life: work productivity, independent living/selfcare, relationships with family and spouse, and relationships with friends, each rated on specific anchor points ranging from 1 (severely limited functioning) to 7 (optimal functioning). The RFS has sound psychometric properties (Goodman et al. 1993) and has been widely used in service outcome studies in schizophrenia (e.g., Green and Gracely 1987;Brekke et al. 1997;Brekke and Long 2000). Examples of anchor points for the family relationships component are as follows: 1 = no contact with any family members or severely deviant behaviors within family network; 4 = relationships that are often minimal and fluctuating in quality (contact once a month); and 7 = positive relationships with several family members and assertive contributions to these relationships. Clinical rating scales. Psychiatric symptoms, including psychotic exacerbations, were assessed using the 24-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; Ventura et al. 1993). This semistructured interview, with specific anchor points, required approximately 20 minutes to complete.

Each sentence was spoken aloud in such a manner as to convey one of the same six emotions used in the Facial Emotion Identification Test. The subjects listened to each sentence and then circled on an answer sheet which of the six emotions best described the speaker's tone of voice. The Videotape Affect Perception Test (Bellack et al. 1996) includes 30 brief scenes from movies and television. At the start of each scene, the subjects were told to attend to a particular character. After viewing each scene, the subjects then selected one of six emotions that best described what that character was feeling. Figure 1.

After viewing each scene, the subjects then selected one of six emotions that best described what that character was feeling. Baseline Role of Clinical Symptoms. Several additional analyses were conducted to determine whether the association between perception of emotion and later work functioning/independent living outcome was affected by psychiatric symptoms. Positive symptoms correlated with emotion perception performance at a trend level at baseline only (r = -0.20, p = 0.075). Conceptual disorganization, on the other hand, was significantly correlated with emotion perception both at baseline (r = -0.39, p < 0.001) and at 12 months (r = -0.38, p = 0.001). A measure of negative symptoms did not correlate with perception of emotion at either time point and was thus not considered further. Based on these correlations, the cross-sectional and cross-temporal correlations between perception of emotion and work functioning/independent living were repeated, partialing out conceptual disorganization. The pattern of results was comparable at baseline (r = 0.30, p = 0.01), 12 months (r = 0.23, p = 0.05), and across the 1-year interval (baseline emotion perception by 1-year work functioning/independent living [r = 0.36, p = 0.002]). Similarly, the results of both the cross-lagged panel analysis (z = 1.95, p = 0.026 1-tailed) and the multiple regression model (t = 4.82, p = 0.0001) were most consistent with the interpretation that better perception of emotion may be a causal factor in improved work functioning/independent living outcome even after controlling for clinical symptoms.

We also examined whether perception of emotion predicted work functioning/independent living skills differently in male and female patients. When we analyzed these relationships separately for the two genders, the correlations were essentially the same (figure 2). For men (n -57) at baseline and 12-month followup, emotion perception performance was moderately correlated with work functioning/independent living skills (r = 0.34, p < 0.02 and r = 0.29, p < 0.03, respectively). The longitudinal association between baseline emotion perception and later work functioning/independent living was also significant (r = 0.40, p < 0.005). For women (n = 24), performance on perception of emotion was correlated with work functioning/independent living at a trend level at both baseline and 12-month followup (r = 0.38, p < 0.06 and r = 0.29, p < 0.10, respectively). Cross-temporal association between baseline emotion perception and later work functioning/independent living skills was significant (r = 0.43, p < 0.04). Finally, we conducted contrast comparisons between all correlation coefficients for males versus females. The correlation coefficients involving emotion perception and work functioning/independent living domains showed no significant differential pattern of associations related to gender.
