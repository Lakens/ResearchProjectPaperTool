Participants
Participants were 90 members of a lower-division psychology course at the University of Missouri, 33 men and 57 women, who participated for extra course credit.
Most participants were sophomores.
Sixty-eight participants were Caucasian, 9 were African American, 9 were Asian, 2 were Hispanic, and 2 were "other."
Participants were informed they could withdraw at any time and that doing so would have no effect on their grades.
