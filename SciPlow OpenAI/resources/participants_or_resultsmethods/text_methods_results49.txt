Method Results
Design The current study utilised a randomised controlled trial design to compare an iCBT program, a CBT self-help book, a meditation self-help book, to a wait-list control for participants meeting diagnostic criteria for MDD. Participants were assessed at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment and at 3 months post-treatment. Baseline demographics and between-groups differences Two hundred and forty-eight participants completed baseline questionnaires and were included in the data analysis. For baseline demographics and sample characteristics see Table 1. There was no significant difference between the groups in age, F (50,197) = 1.09, p > 0.05), or pre-treatment PHQ-9 (F (22,225) = 0.452, p > 0.05), GAD-7 (F (19,183) = 0.768, p > 0.05), K-10 (F (28,219) = 1.41, p > 0.05), or NEO (F (25,225) = 1.35, p > 0.05) scores. Chi-square analyses demonstrated that there were no between-group differences in any other demographic characteristics including gender, marital status, educational status or employment status (ps > 0.05).
Inclusion/exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria were: (i) aged over 18 years (ii) prepared to provide contact details of their General Practitioner (iii) had access to internet and printer, (iv) resident in Australia, (v) fluent in written and spoken English, (vi) a score between 5 and 23 on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale (PHQ-9), (vii) met criteria on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 5.0.0 (MINI) (Sheehan et al., 1998) for DSM-IV criteria for MDD on structured telephone diagnostic interview, (vii) if taking medications for anxiety or depression, were on a stable dose for at least 8 weeks at time of intake interview, and (viii) had not commenced face to face CBT within 4 weeks at time of intake interview. Exclusion Criteria included psychosis or bipolar disorder, drug or alcohol dependency, benzodiazepine use, severe depression PHQ-9 total scores > 24, or current suicidality. Adherence In the iCBT group, 32 of the 54 participants completed all 6 lessons resulting in a 59% adherence rate. Of the 54 participants, 33 participants completed post-treatment assessments (61%) and 30 participants completed 3-month follow-up assessments (56%). In the bCBT group, 47 of the 74 participants provided post-treatment assessments (64%) and 43 completed 3-month follow-up assessments (58%). In the bMED group, 41 of the 61 participants provided post-treatment assessments (67%) and 32 completed 3-month follow-up assessments (52%). In the WLC group, 48 of the 59 participants provided complete data at the post-treatment time point (81%). (See Fig. 1 for participant flow). A total of 30/54 participants in the iCBT group (56%), 43/74 participants in the bCBT group (58%), and 40/61 participants in the bMED group (66%), completed a diagnostic interview to assess for MDD at 3-month follow-up.
Procedure Participants were recruited via the Virtual Clinic (www. virtualclinic.org.au), the research arm of the Clinical Research Unit for Anxiety and Depression, based at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney and the University of New South Wales. Potential applicants viewed advertisements in the form of leaflets and posters and on social media. Applicants completed online screening questionnaires about demographic information and depressive symptoms as assessed on the PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al., 2001), after reading details about the study. Participants who met online screening criteria then participated in a brief telephone interview. Trained interviewers administered a structured diagnostic interview which consisted of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 5.0.0 (MINI) (Sheehan et al., 1998) MDD and risk assessment modules to confirm whether applicants met for DSM-IV criteria for MDD. Full risk assessment modules (where necessary) were completed by a psychiatry registrar to assess suicidal ideation and determine suitability for the study. Expectancy of benefit There were no significant between-group differences in treatment expectancy ratings, either logical ((F (2186) = 1.57, p > 0.05); iCBT: M = 5.81, SD = 2.10; bCBT: M = 6.41, SD = 2.11; bMED: M = 6.39, SD = 5.69) or successful ((F (2186) = 1.84, p > 0.05); iCBT: M = 5.28, SD = 1.65; bCBT: M = 5.85, SD = 1.77; bMED: M = 1.94, SD = 1.63). Results are reported in Table 2.
Participant flow Details of the participant flow are displayed in Fig. 1. A total of 1143 applicants applied online for the study between May 2013 and February 2015. Of these, 549 applicants were excluded after completing initial online screening questions and received an email with information about alternative services. Five hundred and ninety four applicants passed the online screening phase and were telephoned for a diagnostic interview. A further 324 individuals were excluded at telephone interview stage, leaving 270 applicants who met inclusion criteria and were randomised. Eligible participants were randomised based on a random number sequence generated at www.random.org by an independent person not involved in the study. Group allocation numbers were concealed from the interviewer with the use of opaque sealed envelopes, which were opened once the applicant was deemed eligible to participate. Participants provided electronic informed consent before being enrolled in the study. This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/13/SVH/29) of St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Australia. The trial was prospectively registered on ANZCTR (ACTRN12613000502730). Primary and secondary outcome measures and effect sizes at posttreatment Table 3 presents the results of all groups on primary and secondary outcome measures, and see Fig. 2 for PHQ-9 graph. There were significant group by time interactions for all of the primary and secondary outcome measures (PHQ-9: F (6401.84) = 6.26, p < 0.001, K-10:F (6, 399.82) = 6.39, p < 0.001, GAD-7: F (6, 372.87) = 7.38, p < 0.001, NEO: F (6, 397.28) = 5.30, p < 0.001). There were large within-group effect sizes between baseline and post-treatment on all outcome measures in the iCBT, bCBT and bMED groups (g = 0.88-1.69). The reductions in the WLC group were moderate and significant on the PHQ-9 and K-10 (gs = 0.50-0.55), but were small and not significant on the GAD-7 (g = 0.38, 95% CI: -0.01-0.76) and NEO (g = 0.13, 95% CI: -0.25-0.51). Planned pairwise comparisons showed that each of the intervention groups had significantly lower PHQ-9, K-10, GAD-7 and NEO scores relative to WLC at post-treatment (ps < 0.01). There were large between-groups effect sizes on the PHQ-9 (g's = 0.86-0.98), and on the K-10 (gs = 0.83-0.91), except for a moderate effect size between bMED and WLC on K-10 scores at post-treatment (g = 0.60). We found moderate effect sizes between the intervention groups and WLC on the GAD-7 (gs = 0.55-0.77), and moderate (iCBT v WLC: g = 0.64; bMED v WLC: g = 0.77) to large (bCBT v WLC: g = 0.85) effect size differences on the NEO. There were no significant differences between iCBT, bCBT or bMED groups on any of the outcome measures at post-treatment (ps > 0.05). The between-groups effect sizes revealed small (but not significant) effect sizes favouring the bCBT group over the bMED group on the GAD-7 and K-10 (gs = 0.23), small but not significant effect sizes favouring iCBT over bMED on the K-10 (g = 0.31), and small but not significant effect sizes favouring bCBT over iCBT on the NEO (g = 0.21). Of note, post-hoc power calculations indicated that at 0.8 power (Î± = 0.05), the actual sample size (minimum of 54 per group) had power to detect a between-groups effect size difference of d = 0.54.
Interventions Primary and secondary outcome measures and effect sizes at 3-month follow-up To explore whether there were any between-groups differences between the iCBT, bCBT and bMED groups between post-treatment and 3-month follow-up, linear mixed-models were conducted separately for each of the dependent variable measures, with time (with post and follow-up scores entered in the model), treatment group, and the group by time interaction entered as fixed factors in the model. Results are reported in Table 4, and see Fig. 2 for PHQ-9 graph. There was a significant group by time interaction between posttreatment and 3-month follow-up on the PHQ-9 (F (2, 99.60) = 4.19, p < 0.05). Between-group comparisons revealed that 3-month followup scores on the PHQ-9 were significantly higher, with moderate between-groups differences in the bMED relative to the bCBT group (g = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.26-1.20), and a trend towards higher PHQ-9 scores in the bMED compared to iCBT groups (g = 0.46, 95%CI: -0.04-0.97, p = 0.066). Within-groups comparisons between posttreatment and follow-up revealed that the bMED experienced moderate and significant deterioration in PHQ-9 scores between post-treatment and follow-up (within-group g = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.09-1.04). The changes in PHQ-9 scores in the iCBT and bCBT groups were not significant. The group by time interactions were not significant for the remaining variables (K-10: F (2, 100.41) = 1.24, p > 0.05, GAD-7: F (2, 99.05) = 1.84, p > 0.05, NEO: F (2, 101.60) = 1.32, p > 0.05). Within-group comparisons between post-treatment and follow-up for each group on the K-10, GAD-7, and NEO scores were not significant (ps > 0.05), although effect sizes indicated small (not significant) increases in GAD-7 (g = 0.28, 95% CI: -0.19-0.74), and K-10 scores (g = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.16-0.77) in the bMED group, and small (but not significant) decreases in NEO scores in the bCBT group (g = 0.25, 95% CI: -0.16-0.67).
Sadness program (iCBT) The Sadness program was delivered through www.virtualclinic.org. au. The program has been evaluated in four previous trials and its efficacy has been established (Perini et al., 2008, 2009, Titov et al., 2010, Watts et al., 2013) (between-groups effect sizes: d = 0.8-1.3, within-group pre-post effect sizes: d = 0.9-1.0). The program consisted (Tanner and Ball, 2012) This is a self-help book designed to help people overcome depression and was posted to participants in this group, along with a short (one page) welcome letter from the book authors introducing participants to the concept of cognitive therapy and advising them to tackle the issues presented in the book systematically and one at a time. Participants were asked to work through each of the 12 chapters over 12 weeks and advised to read roughly one chapter per week. The book is self-guiding; the content is based on CBT and organised into various parts, including: Understanding Depression, Our Thinking Habits, Looking After Your Needs and Living with Someone Who is Depressed. The course content is presented in Table 6. Questionnaires and reminders to complete questionnaires were emailed to participants in this group with clinical contact occurring only if a participant reported active suicidal intent. In cases of elevated or increased distress response scores, participants were emailed to advise them where to gain additional support -including telephone counselling numbers, visiting their general practitioner or Emergency Services. No guidance or encouragement was offered. 2.5.3. Silence your mind (bMED) (Manocha, 2013) This is a self-help book aimed at teaching people to meditate and was posted to participants in this group, along with an instructional DVD, information booklet and a brief (two page) letter from the author introducing participants to the mediation technique described in the book and advising them to practice the technique for at least 10 min per day. Participants were asked to work through each of the 13 chapters over 12 weeks and advised to read roughly one chapter per week. The book is self-guiding; the content is based on a meditative approach called Mental Silence and is organised into various parts, including: What is Meditation, Meditation is Mental Silence, Health, Wellbeing and the non-mind, Helping our Young People, Flow and Optimal Being, and The Brain in Meditation. The course content is presented in Table 7. Questionnaires and reminders to complete questionnaires were emailed to participants in this group with clinical contact only occurring if a participant reported active suicidal intent. In cases of elevated or increased distress response scores, participants were emailed to advise them where to gain additional support -including telephone counselling numbers, visiting their general practitioner or Emergency Services. No guidance or encouragement was offered. Diagnostic status at follow-up Of the participants that completed a 3-month follow-up telephone interview, 24/30 (80%) in the iCBT group, 34/43 (79%) in the bCBT and 30/40 (75%) in the bMED group no longer met criteria for MDD. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of recovered patients in the intervention groups (Ï 2 (4,n = 189) = 1.66, p = 0.79).
Wait-list control group (WLC) Participants randomised to the wait-list control (WLC) were able to continue with any course of treatment already specified at intake interview but were withdrawn from the study if they commenced a new treatment during the course of the 12 week waiting period, for example starting psychotherapy or medication for anxiety or depression. Questionnaires and reminders to complete questionnaires were emailed to participants in this group with clinical contact occurring in cases of elevated or increased distress response scores or when a participant reported suicidal intent. Participants had the choice of enrolling in either iCBT or one of the two self-books once their 12 week waiting period had ceased and they had completed all questionnaires. Clinical significance Following Jacobson and Truax (1991) reliable change index (RCI) values were calculated for the PHQ-9 scores to determine the proportion of each group who evidenced reliable improvements (or deterioration) in PHQ-9 scores between baseline and follow-up. RCI values were calculated using test-retest reliability values of 0.84 from Kroenke et al. (2001). In order to calculate standard error of measurement values, standard deviations were derived from current sample (PHQ-9 pretreatment pooled SD = 4.37). A change of 5 points on the PHQ-9 was considered to be statistically reliable change. Of the iCBT group, 21/54 (61.1%) reliably improved compared to 36/74 (48.6%) in the bCBT group, 31/61 (50.8%) in the bMED group, and 21/59 (35.6%) in the WLC group. There was no evidence of deterioration in the iCBT group, but there was evidence of deterioration on the PHQ-9 for one in the bCBT group (1.4%), one in the bMED group (1.6%), and 6 individuals in the WLC group (10.2%).
Clinician contact All participants completing the iCBT course received email and/or phone contact with the technician after the first two lessons to answer any questions about the program and to encourage them with the remainder of the course, then as requested. In cases of increased distress, particularly elevated distress and or suicidal intent was reported, the clinician made contact with the participant. Participants in the bCBT and bMED groups with elevated distress were emailed to inform them that their distress was elevated and where to get appropriate external support. The clinician did make contact with participants in these groups who reported suicidal intent. Missing data analysis Because there was a significant proportion of missing data on the primary outcome measure (PHQ-9) at post-treatment, we analysed missing data patterns. First, Little's MCAR test was not significant for post-treatment scores (Ï 2 = 0.57, p = 0.45), or follow-up scores (Ï 2 = 1.29, p = 0.26). Second, we conducted independent samples ttests to explore whether there were any significant differences between those with missing data versus those with complete data at posttreatment. Compared to participants who provided post-treatment data (n = 169: M = 32.73, SD = 6.18), those who had missing data were significantly more distressed at baseline on the K-10 (n = 79: M = 34.32, SD = 5.13) (t(246, = 1.99, p = 0.048), however there were no significant differences between those with and without data at post-treatment on age or other demographics (e.g., marital and education status), baseline PHQ-9 scores, GAD-7 scores, or NEO scores (ps > 0.05). There was also no statistically significant relationship between treatment group and the proportion of participants with missing data (Ï 2 (3) = 6.73, p = 0.08). In addition to these analyses, a multiple imputation procedure was used to account for the data lost at post-treatment and 3-month followup (for the intervention groups only). We assume the value of the data lost relates to observed variables in the dataset. The multiple imputation procedure was implemented in SPSS, using a chained equations multiple imputation procedure, with five imputations. ANOVAS were conducted on imputed post-treatment and follow-up PHQ-9 data to explore whether the significant between-group differences in the main mixed models analysis remained after imputation. The pooled estimates for the imputed data for the four groups at post-treatment were: iCBT: M = 8.21, SE = 1.03, bCBT: M = 8.15, SE = 0.86, bMed: M = 8.73, SE = 0.78, WLC: M = 13.17, SE = 0.83. The between-group differences between the three intervention groups and WLC remained significant for post-treatment PHQ-9 scores (ps < 0.001), and there were no significant differences between the three intervention groups (iCBT, bCBT, bMed). In addition, mirroring the findings from the mixed models in the main analysis, there was a significant group difference on PHQ-9 scores at 3-month follow-up, with the bCBT reporting significantly lower PHQ-9 scores than the bMed group. The pooled estimates for the imputed data for the three treatment groups at follow-up were: iCBT: M = 8.92, bCBT: M = 7.78, SE = 1.21, SE = 1.39, bMed: M = 11.64, SE = 1.04.
Measures Clinician contact There was a significant difference across groups in the total time (minutes) spent contacting the participants (total time spent: F (3, 244) = 15.35, p < 0.001); given the iCBT group was guided, planned comparisons indicated significantly more time was spent by the technician contacting iCBT participants compared to each of the other three groups (p's < 0.001). The technician spent an average of 9.7 min (SD = 5.02, range = 3-21) emailing and calling each participant in the iCBT group during the treatment course (including follow-up period). There were no overall between-group differences in the time spent contacting the participants by the clinician (F (3, 244) = 1.84, p > 0.05). The majority of participants across all groups did not require contact with a clinician (iCBT: 81%; bCBT: 95%; bMED: 92%; WLC: 90%).
Diagnostic status The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 5.0.0 (MINI (Sheehan et al., 1998)) MDD and risk assessment modules were administered at intake, and then again at 3 month follow-up for the intervention group participants (assessors were not blinded to the intervention condition). Patient satisfaction There were no overall between-group differences in either treatment satisfaction ((F(2, 118) = 1.98, p > 0.05); iCBT: M = 6.45, SD = 1.84; bCBT: M = 6.02, SD = 2.14; bMED: M = 5.49, SD = 2.25), or confidence in recommending the program to a friend ((F(2, 118) = 1.57, p > 0.05); iCBT: M = 6.73, SD = 2.32; bCBT: M = 6.15, SD = 2.41; bMED: M = 5.71, SD = 2.62).
Primary outcome measure The Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ-9, (Kroenke et al., 2001) is a 9-item self-report scale that was used to assesses DSM-IV criteria for MDD. Participants were asked to rate the frequency of symptoms (including frequency of suicidal ideation with the question "thoughts that you would be better off dead, or of hurting yourself in some way"), over the past two weeks. The scale range is: 0 = not at all, 1 = several days, 2 = more than half of the days and 3 = nearly every day, with total scores ranging from 0 to 27. The PHQ-9 has shown to have excellent reliability and validity (0.86; (Kroenke et al., 2001). Results
Secondary outcome measures The Kessler-10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10; (Kessler et al., 2002) is a 10-item self-report scale that was used to measure non-specific psychological distress over the past two weeks. Rated on a 5-point scale, higher scores indicate higher distress levels. The K10 has excellent psychometric properties (Furukawa et al., 2003). The Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7; (Spitzer et al., 2006)) was used to measure generalised anxiety disorder symptoms over the past two weeks on the same 4-point scale as the PHQ-9. Scores range from 0 to 21, and this scale has good reliability and validity (0.83; (Spitzer et al., 2006). The NEO-Five Factor Inventory -Neuroticism Subscale (NEO-FFI, (Costa and McCrae, 1985)) is a 5-point self-report scale which was used to measure the personality dimension of Neuroticism and has good psychometric properties (Cuijpers et al., 2005). Baseline demographics and between-groups differences Two hundred and forty-eight participants completed baseline questionnaires and were included in the data analysis. For baseline demographics and sample characteristics see Table 1. There was no significant difference between the groups in age, F (50,197) = 1.09, p > 0.05), or pre-treatment PHQ-9 (F (22,225) = 0.452, p > 0.05), GAD-7 (F (19,183) = 0.768, p > 0.05), K-10 (F (28,219) = 1.41, p > 0.05), or NEO (F (25,225) = 1.35, p > 0.05) scores. Chi-square analyses demonstrated that there were no between-group differences in any other demographic characteristics including gender, marital status, educational status or employment status (ps > 0.05).
Expectancy of benefit and patient satisfaction Prior to the start of their respective intervention, participants in iCBT, bCBT and bMED were asked to provide a treatment expectancy rating. Participants were asked to provide a rating ranging from 1 to 9 about how logical the therapy offered to them seemed, and how successful they thought the treatment will be in reducing their symptoms of depression (where 1 = not at all, 5 = somewhat, and 9 = very). To examine treatment satisfaction, participants were asked at post-treatment i) how satisfied they were that the program taught them the skills to manage depression and ii) their confidence in recommending the program to a friend with similar problems (range: 1 = not at all, 5 = somewhat, and 9 = very). Adherence In the iCBT group, 32 of the 54 participants completed all 6 lessons resulting in a 59% adherence rate. Of the 54 participants, 33 participants completed post-treatment assessments (61%) and 30 participants completed 3-month follow-up assessments (56%). In the bCBT group, 47 of the 74 participants provided post-treatment assessments (64%) and 43 completed 3-month follow-up assessments (58%). In the bMED group, 41 of the 61 participants provided post-treatment assessments (67%) and 32 completed 3-month follow-up assessments (52%). In the WLC group, 48 of the 59 participants provided complete data at the post-treatment time point (81%). (See Fig. 1 for participant flow). A total of 30/54 participants in the iCBT group (56%), 43/74 participants in the bCBT group (58%), and 40/61 participants in the bMED group (66%), completed a diagnostic interview to assess for MDD at 3-month follow-up.
Outcome measurement At baseline, participants provided basic demographic details (e.g., age, marital status, gender, employment and educational history), depression history and treatment, and current comorbid physical illnesses (6 questions from the 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (Teesson et al., 2011). All four groups completed outcome measures at baseline, mid-point (Lesson 4 for iCBT and week 6 for the book groups and WLC), posttreatment (one week after Lesson 6 for iCBT or at the end of the 12 weeks for the book groups and WLC) and at 3-month follow-up (for iCBT and the book groups only). The iCBT group completed the K10 before commencing every lesson. Expectancy of benefit There were no significant between-group differences in treatment expectancy ratings, either logical ((F (2186) = 1.57, p > 0.05); iCBT: M = 5.81, SD = 2.10; bCBT: M = 6.41, SD = 2.11; bMED: M = 6.39, SD = 5.69) or successful ((F (2186) = 1.84, p > 0.05); iCBT: M = 5.28, SD = 1.65; bCBT: M = 5.85, SD = 1.77; bMED: M = 1.94, SD = 1.63). Results are reported in Table 2.
Power calculations Prior to commencement of the trial, a power calculation was conducted to set the minimum sample size needed. At 0.8 power (alpha = 0.05), 100 participants per group were needed to have the power to detect a 0.4 effect size difference in efficacy between groups. However, due to unanticipated difficulties with recruitment during the time-period set out for the study, the final sample (N = 270) fell short of the sample size needed (N = 400). Primary and secondary outcome measures and effect sizes at posttreatment Table 3 presents the results of all groups on primary and secondary outcome measures, and see Fig. 2 for PHQ-9 graph. There were significant group by time interactions for all of the primary and secondary outcome measures (PHQ-9: F (6401.84) = 6.26, p < 0.001, K-10:F (6, 399.82) = 6.39, p < 0.001, GAD-7: F (6, 372.87) = 7.38, p < 0.001, NEO: F (6, 397.28) = 5.30, p < 0.001). There were large within-group effect sizes between baseline and post-treatment on all outcome measures in the iCBT, bCBT and bMED groups (g = 0.88-1.69). The reductions in the WLC group were moderate and significant on the PHQ-9 and K-10 (gs = 0.50-0.55), but were small and not significant on the GAD-7 (g = 0.38, 95% CI: -0.01-0.76) and NEO (g = 0.13, 95% CI: -0.25-0.51). Planned pairwise comparisons showed that each of the intervention groups had significantly lower PHQ-9, K-10, GAD-7 and NEO scores relative to WLC at post-treatment (ps < 0.01). There were large between-groups effect sizes on the PHQ-9 (g's = 0.86-0.98), and on the K-10 (gs = 0.83-0.91), except for a moderate effect size between bMED and WLC on K-10 scores at post-treatment (g = 0.60). We found moderate effect sizes between the intervention groups and WLC on the GAD-7 (gs = 0.55-0.77), and moderate (iCBT v WLC: g = 0.64; bMED v WLC: g = 0.77) to large (bCBT v WLC: g = 0.85) effect size differences on the NEO. There were no significant differences between iCBT, bCBT or bMED groups on any of the outcome measures at post-treatment (ps > 0.05). The between-groups effect sizes revealed small (but not significant) effect sizes favouring the bCBT group over the bMED group on the GAD-7 and K-10 (gs = 0.23), small but not significant effect sizes favouring iCBT over bMED on the K-10 (g = 0.31), and small but not significant effect sizes favouring bCBT over iCBT on the NEO (g = 0.21). Of note, post-hoc power calculations indicated that at 0.8 power (Î± = 0.05), the actual sample size (minimum of 54 per group) had power to detect a between-groups effect size difference of d = 0.54.
Statistical analyses Groups were compared at baseline using t-tests and chi square analyses where the data consisted of categorical data. To explore the impact of the treatment groups on outcome, linear mixed models were conducted separately for each of the dependent variable measures with time, treatment group, and the time by group interaction entered as fixed factors in the model. For each group, planned contrasts were used to compare changes within and between-groups from baseline to posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. Between-group effect sizes using the pooled standard deviation and adjusted for sample size (Hedges g) were calculated to compare between groups at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Within-group effect sizes (Hedges g) were calculated between pre-and post-treatment and between pre-and 3-month follow-up for each of the intervention groups. Primary and secondary outcome measures and effect sizes at 3-month follow-up To explore whether there were any between-groups differences between the iCBT, bCBT and bMED groups between post-treatment and 3-month follow-up, linear mixed-models were conducted separately for each of the dependent variable measures, with time (with post and follow-up scores entered in the model), treatment group, and the group by time interaction entered as fixed factors in the model. Results are reported in Table 4, and see Fig. 2 for PHQ-9 graph. There was a significant group by time interaction between posttreatment and 3-month follow-up on the PHQ-9 (F (2, 99.60) = 4.19, p < 0.05). Between-group comparisons revealed that 3-month followup scores on the PHQ-9 were significantly higher, with moderate between-groups differences in the bMED relative to the bCBT group (g = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.26-1.20), and a trend towards higher PHQ-9 scores in the bMED compared to iCBT groups (g = 0.46, 95%CI: -0.04-0.97, p = 0.066). Within-groups comparisons between posttreatment and follow-up revealed that the bMED experienced moderate and significant deterioration in PHQ-9 scores between post-treatment and follow-up (within-group g = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.09-1.04). The changes in PHQ-9 scores in the iCBT and bCBT groups were not significant. The group by time interactions were not significant for the remaining variables (K-10: F (2, 100.41) = 1.24, p > 0.05, GAD-7: F (2, 99.05) = 1.84, p > 0.05, NEO: F (2, 101.60) = 1.32, p > 0.05). Within-group comparisons between post-treatment and follow-up for each group on the K-10, GAD-7, and NEO scores were not significant (ps > 0.05), although effect sizes indicated small (not significant) increases in GAD-7 (g = 0.28, 95% CI: -0.19-0.74), and K-10 scores (g = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.16-0.77) in the bMED group, and small (but not significant) decreases in NEO scores in the bCBT group (g = 0.25, 95% CI: -0.16-0.67).
