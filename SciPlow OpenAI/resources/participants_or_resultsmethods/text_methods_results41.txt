Methods The protocol of the Cardiovascular Risk and E-couch Depression Outcome (CREDO) trial has been published elsewhere. [10] In summary, CREDO was an internet-based, double-blind, parallel group randomised controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of internet cognitive behavioural therapy (E-couch) with an online attention control (HealthWatch). The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see Protocol S1 and Checklist S1. Participants were recruited through the 45 and Up Study, a largescale longitudinal population-based cohort study comprising over 260,000 men and women aged 45 years and over in New South Wales (NSW), Australia [11] recruited between 2006 and 2009. Comparative analysis of data from the 45 and Up Study against the NSW Population Health Survey has demonstrated that, for a range of health and behavioural parameters the participants and associations found in the 45 and Up Study are broadly representative of the general population. [12] From July 2010 to January 2011, 8000 participants who had met the following screening criteria according to their responses to the 45 and Up Study questionnaire were invited to take part in CREDO:-. Those screened as potentially eligible were invited by email to log on to a website where they were provided with study information, an opportunity to question the researchers, and online consent was obtained by indicating their agreement with two statements with yes/no response buttons. Once consented, they were directed to another webpage where they completed online baseline assessments and an automated cognitive assessment battery (CogState). [15] Participants were eligible for trial inclusion if they scored 8 or more on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [16,17] at this assessment, indicating persistent or recurrent symptoms. This criteria identifying at least mild-moderate depression, between the standard 5 (mild) and 10 (moderate) cutpoints [17] was chosen on the basis of pilot recruitment work to establish the lowest level at which recruitment would meet sample size requirements. Those who reported currently undergoing psychotherapy or expressed suicidal ideation on question 9 of the PHQ-9 at baseline were excluded from the trial. The latter went through a risk management protocol for further management. One week later participants were prompted by email to login to the trial site and confirm their continued willingness to participate and were randomised. Participants were blinded to which programme was the ''active'' intervention. Results Of 7086 invitations to potential participants, 1862 (26%) provided consent and proceeded to eligibility screening. Those consenting were more likely to be female (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1. 19), speak English at home (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.15-1.90) have a higher education (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.46-1.92) and a prior doctor's diagnosis of depression (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.22-1.55): these variables were not associated with outcome amongst trial participants. [29] Only 696/1862 (37%) of those consenting met trial inclusion criteria, of whom 116/696 (17%) failed to complete baseline survey or return to website for randomisation and 18/696 (2.5%) withdrew consent before commencing leaving 562/696 (80.5%) who proceeded through to baseline assessment and randomisation (Figure S1). Baseline characteristics were well matched between trial arms with no socio-demographic, or health differences (Table 1). There were no differences in baseline depression severity (PHQ-9 mean difference 0.2; 95%CI; 20.4-0.8) or the other outcome scores between arms (Tables 2 and3). Participants had a mean age of 58 years, the majority were female (61.4%), married or partnered (72.6%), spoke English at home (94.5%) and had an education after basic schooling (72.7%). Over half (53.6%) had had a previous diagnosis of depression and 70% were already diagnosed and treated for existing cardiovascular disease. The remaining 30% had 2 or more other risk factors: obesity, being a current smoker, a strong family history of CVD or aged over 65. Obesity (BMI.30) was common (45.6%) but smoking uncommon (14.2%). The majority, 314/562 (56%) had another comorbid chronic physical health problem including cancer, thrombosis, osteoarthritis, Parkinson's disease, asthma or thyroid disease. Of trial participants, 260/280 (93%) assigned to iCBT and 278/ 282 (99%) assigned to the control arm provided at least one post baseline measure. All participants contributed to the analysis in the ITT modelling approach. Complete post intervention depression scores were available for more of those in the control arm (97%) than those assigned iCBT 76%), (Odds ratio 9.36, 95% CI: 6.36-13.75). Baseline depression severity (PHQ-9 score) was not associated with study dropout overall (Odds ratio = 0.97, p = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.90-1.05) but in the iCBT arm a linear association of baseline depression severity and dropout approached significance (Odds ratio = 0.92, p = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.84-1.001). The direction of the association implies that participants with higher levels of depression at baseline were less likely to withdraw from the trial. There was no depression-attrition association in the control arm. Attrition was not associated with any demographic factor or outcome except that it was more common amongst the small group (n = 31 (5.5%)) who did not speak English as their first language at home. The observed results for all outcomes at baseline and post intervention are presented in Tables 2 and3 and the estimated means and contrasts from the MMRM approach in Table 4. Primary Outcome -Depression Symptom Severity (Tables 2 and4, Figure S2) Participants in both arms showed symptomatic improvement by, on average (observed means) 3.66 (95% CI: 3.05-4.27) points with iCBT and 2.60 points (95%CI 2.05-3.16) in the control group, with a significantly greater decline in the PHQ-9 for iCBT compared to control (1.06; 95%CI: 0.23-1.89; time by arm interaction p = .012). The effect was seen both those being treated for CVD and those just with a higher risk status :the time by condition by CVD treatment interaction was not significant, indicating no reliable differential effects (F test for the interaction is F(3,505.8) = 0.76, p = 0.5078). This difference was slightly less than that hypothesised: 0.22 standard deviations of the mean observed change score. Secondary Outcome -Adherence to Medical and Lifestyle Intervention (Tables 2 and4) Specific adherence scores were available for all participants at baseline and at follow-up for 204/280 (73%) participants in the iCBT arm and 272/282 (96%) participants assigned to the control group. Assignment to iCBT resulted in adherence scores higher by 2.16 points (95% CI: 0.33-3.99). Only 2 participants reported no medical or lifestyle intervention behaviours at all. Tertiary Outcomes (Tables 234) The iCBT resulted in greater anxiety score (GAD-7 [23]) improvement by 2.44 (95%CI: 1.87-3.02) points with iCBT compared to 1.48 (95%CI:0.97-1.99) in the control group with a difference in means of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.19-1.73) points (time by arm interaction p = 0.014). There was a greater proportion engaging in activity sufficient to confer a health benefit post intervention (150 mins over 5 occasions/week); 67% in iCBT vs. 61% in the control group (Odds Ratio 1.91, 95%CI: 1.01-3.61), but no differential improvement in average walking time per day: time by arm interaction (Odds ratio = 1.46, 95% CI: 0.81-2.62), (table 3). Although disability improved slightly in both groups (iCBT 1.08 (95% CI: 0.55-1.61), Control: 0.68 (95% CI: 0.22-1.14) there was no differential advantage for iCBT: (mean difference 0.40 (95% CI: 20.30-1.10), time by arm interaction p = 0.262) or when assessed as cut back days (Odds ratio = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.48-1.41), (table 3).
Randomisation Randomisation was undertaken using a customised, fully automated randomisation facility built into the trial website. Participants were randomised to receive either the intervention programme (E-couch) or the attention control programme (Health-Watch) and were stratified by depressive symptom severity using permuted block sizes of eight. Symptom severity was determined using PHQ-9 scores [16,17], where scores ranging from 8 to 14 were classified as moderate, and scores ranging from 15 to 27 classified as major. Allocation was concealed from participants and researchers and assessments were all self report. Internet Delivered CBT Arm: E-couch E-couch (http://www.ecouch.anu.edu.au/welcome) comprises 12 modules of psychoeducation (mental health literacy), cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) techniques that have evidence supporting their use in depression. The CBT and mental health literacy components of E-couch are extended versions of the MoodGYM [18] and BluePages [19] internet interventions, which have had effectiveness demonstrated in previous trials. [6,[18][19][20][21][22][23]. Adverse Outcomes After enrolment 44 participants reported a score of 2 or more on item 9 of the PHQ-9 indicating a risk of deliberate self harm: 21 in the iCBT arm and 23 in the control arm All of these were contacted by clinicians, masked to treatment allocation, as part of the risk management protocol. None were deemed acute clinical risks and none were removed from the study.
Attention Control Arm: HealthWatch HealthWatch is a 12-week online programme that delivers health information on topics including nutrition, stroke, physical activity, medicines in the home, blood pressure and cholesterol, and heart health to provide an attention matched control. In order to replicate the interactive component of the active treatment arm, participants also completed online questionnaires that probed their views about the importance of health factors, physical activities, hobbies, work habits and stress, medications, and alcohol use. Although providing valid health information, HealthWatch is a slightly extended version of the attention control that has previously been shown to have limited effects on depression [20]. Results Of 7086 invitations to potential participants, 1862 (26%) provided consent and proceeded to eligibility screening. Those consenting were more likely to be female (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1. 19), speak English at home (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.15-1.90) have a higher education (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.46-1.92) and a prior doctor's diagnosis of depression (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.22-1.55): these variables were not associated with outcome amongst trial participants.

Programme Delivery Modules in both interventions were made available sequentially weekly, with email updates. They have been reported to take between 30 and 60 minutes to complete in other studies. [18][19][20][21][22][23] Participants were not able to access the new module until they had completed the previous one. A link on the email provided support for technological problems. If a participant had not completed the current module within 4 days of its release, an automated reminder email was sent, followed by a phone call or text message three to four days after the reminder email if they had still not yet completed the new module. The phone calls did not provide any psychological intervention but did attempt to help the participant identify and overcome barriers to logging onto the site e.g. suggestions of how to incorporate the intervention into their schedule. If the participant had not completed three consecutive modules and not been contactable no further phone calls were made. This process was identical for both active intervention and attention control arms. The investigators, analysts, trial manager and all participants were blind to treatment allocation for the duration of the trial. Any trial participant who reported suicidal ideation at any post baseline assessment episode underwent a risk management protocol by a blinded clinician for further management including a decision on whether to continue with the trial. The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12610000085077) http://www.anzctr.org.au/ ACTRN12610000085077.aspx. Adverse Outcomes After enrolment 44 participants reported a score of 2 or more on item 9 of the PHQ-9 indicating a risk of deliberate self harm: 21 in the iCBT arm and 23 in the control arm All of these were contacted by clinicians, masked to treatment allocation, as part of the risk management protocol. None were deemed acute clinical risks and none were removed from the study.
Outcome Measures Assessments were conducted at baseline and post intervention (12 weeks), with additional data for the primary outcome obtained at 4 and 8 weeks. Depressive symptoms. The primary prespecified outcome for the trial was severity of depressive symptoms from baseline to post intervention (12 weeks) measured using the PHQ-9; a nineitem assessment of depressive symptoms. This provides a summary score ranging from 0 to 27. The PHQ-9 has been found to be a reliable and valid measure, widely used in previous community studies of people with depression and is sensitive to change in clinical status. [16,17]. Adherence. The prespecified secondary outcome of adherence to CVD treatment and lifestyle advice was measured using the ''specific'' component score of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Measures of Patient Adherence Scale. This measure (score 0-100) is constructed from 15 questions assessing adherence to treatment and healthy behaviour recommendations e.g. exercise, diet and social support. It has been shown to be sensitive to changes in adherence and mood. [24] The more general (0-100) measure, comprising 4 questions about adherence to doctor's advice, relies upon the individual having seen a doctor in the last four weeks and so was not applicable for many participants in this sample. The other prespecified secondary outcome was change in cognitive function at one year and will be reported when the twelve month outcomes are available. Prespecified tertiary outcomes [10] were; anxiety measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), [25] activity (using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), [26] specifically the average time spent walking per day and a composite measure of undertaking enough exercise to provide a health benefit (defined as at least 150 mins of activity over 5 or more occasions each week), and disability assessed by the WHODAS II (total score 0-100 and number of cutback days in last month). [27]. Results Of 7086 invitations to potential participants, 1862 (26%) provided consent and proceeded to eligibility screening. Those consenting were more likely to be female (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1. 19), speak English at home (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.15-1.90) have a higher education (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.46-1.92) and a prior doctor's diagnosis of depression (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.22-1.55): these variables were not associated with outcome amongst trial participants. [29] Only 696/1862 (37%) of those consenting met trial inclusion criteria, of whom 116/696 (17%) failed to complete baseline survey or return to website for randomisation and 18/696 (2.5%) withdrew consent before commencing leaving 562/696 (80.5%) who proceeded through to baseline assessment and randomisation (Figure S1). Baseline characteristics were well matched between trial arms with no socio-demographic, or health differences (Table 1). There were no differences in baseline depression severity (PHQ-9 mean difference 0.2; 95%CI; 20.4-0.8) or the other outcome scores between arms (Tables 2 and3). Participants had a mean age of 58 years, the majority were female (61.4%), married or partnered (72.6%), spoke English at home (94.5%) and had an education after basic schooling (72.7%). Over half (53.6%) had had a previous diagnosis of depression and 70% were already diagnosed and treated for existing cardiovascular disease. The remaining 30% had 2 or more other risk factors: obesity, being a current smoker, a strong family history of CVD or aged over 65. Obesity (BMI.30) was common (45.6%) but smoking uncommon (14.2%). The majority, 314/562 (56%) had another comorbid chronic physical health problem including cancer, thrombosis, osteoarthritis, Parkinson's disease, asthma or thyroid disease. Of trial participants, 260/280 (93%) assigned to iCBT and 278/ 282 (99%) assigned to the control arm provided at least one post baseline measure. All participants contributed to the analysis in the ITT modelling approach. Complete post intervention depression scores were available for more of those in the control arm (97%) than those assigned iCBT 76%), (Odds ratio 9.36, 95% CI: 6.36-13.75). Baseline depression severity (PHQ-9 score) was not associated with study dropout overall (Odds ratio = 0.97, p = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.90-1.05) but in the iCBT arm a linear association of baseline depression severity and dropout approached significance (Odds ratio = 0.92, p = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.84-1.001). The direction of the association implies that participants with higher levels of depression at baseline were less likely to withdraw from the trial. There was no depression-attrition association in the control arm. Attrition was not associated with any demographic factor or outcome except that it was more common amongst the small group (n = 31 (5.5%)) who did not speak English as their first language at home. The observed results for all outcomes at baseline and post intervention are presented in Tables 2 and3 and the estimated means and contrasts from the MMRM approach in Table 4. Primary Outcome -Depression Symptom Severity (Tables 2 and4, Figure S2) Participants in both arms showed symptomatic improvement by, on average (observed means) 3.66 (95% CI: 3.05-4.27) points with iCBT and 2.60 points (95%CI 2.05-3.16) in the control group, with a significantly greater decline in the PHQ-9 for iCBT compared to control (1.06; 95%CI: 0.23-1.89; time by arm interaction p = .012). The effect was seen both those being treated for CVD and those just with a higher risk status :the time by condition by CVD treatment interaction was not significant, indicating no reliable differential effects (F test for the interaction is F(3,505.8) = 0.76, p = 0.5078). This difference was slightly less than that hypothesised: 0.22 standard deviations of the mean observed change score. Secondary Outcome -Adherence to Medical and Lifestyle Intervention (Tables 2 and4) Specific adherence scores were available for all participants at baseline and at follow-up for 204/280 (73%) participants in the iCBT arm and 272/282 (96%) participants assigned to the control group. Assignment to iCBT resulted in adherence scores higher by 2.16 points (95% CI: 0.33-3.99). Only 2 participants reported no medical or lifestyle intervention behaviours at all. Tertiary Outcomes (Tables 234) The iCBT resulted in greater anxiety score (GAD-7 [23]) improvement by 2.44 (95%CI: 1.87-3.02) points with iCBT compared to 1.48 (95%CI:0.97-1.99) in the control group with a difference in means of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.19-1.73) points (time by arm interaction p = 0.014). There was a greater proportion engaging in activity sufficient to confer a health benefit post intervention (150 mins over 5 occasions/week); 67% in iCBT vs. 61% in the control group (Odds Ratio 1.91, 95%CI: 1.01-3.61), but no differential improvement in average walking time per day: time by arm interaction (Odds ratio = 1.46, 95% CI: 0.81-2.62), (table 3). Although disability improved slightly in both groups (iCBT 1.08 (95% CI: 0.55-1.61), Control: 0.68 (95% CI: 0.22-1.14) there was no differential advantage for iCBT: (mean difference 0.40 (95% CI: 20.30-1.10), time by arm interaction p = 0.262) or when assessed as cut back days (Odds ratio = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.48-1.41), (table 3).
Sample Size The total study sample size of 470 was specified to detect a minimum difference of 0.3 standard deviations between groups in mean change in depressive symptom scores at the trial end point, with power of 90%, two-tailed a = 0.05, assuming a correlation of 0.5 between baseline and endpoint scores. Participation and eligibility rates and drop out from previous studies suggested that approximately 20% of those invited would consent to be assessed for trial participation, of whom 50% [18][19][20] would be ineligible and 20% would drop out over the study. Accordingly, 5650 were initially contacted. Due to a greater than expected number of emails not being current, a further 2350 were invited two months into the study recruitment. This increased the number of people attempted to be contacted to 8000, of whom 914 had a subsequent known failure through invalid details, leaving a potential sample of 7086. Adverse Outcomes After enrolment 44 participants reported a score of 2 or more on item 9 of the PHQ-9 indicating a risk of deliberate self harm: 21 in the iCBT arm and 23 in the control arm All of these were contacted by clinicians, masked to treatment allocation, as part of the risk management protocol. None were deemed acute clinical risks and none were removed from the study.
Analysis Analyses were undertaken on an intention to treat (ITT) basis using mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance (MMRM) using the SPSS MIXED procedure. Within person variation was modelled using an unstructured covariance matrix with degrees of freedom estimated using the Satterwhaite approximation. A planned contrast evaluated differences from baseline to post-invention change between treatment arms. A post hoc analysis evaluated any outcome interaction with the presence or not of treated CVD. Where non-normality of residuals was found, appropriate transformations were applied. These yielded conclusions consistent with analyses of raw scores and thus only the results on familiar scales are presented. Other continuous outcomes were analysed using the same approach but, as there are only two time points for each test, the interaction was a direct test of the significance of differential change between conditions. Cohen's d effect sizes for the difference between arms were calculated for each occasion of measurement using observed means and pooled post-intervention variance estimates, with confidence intervals calculated using the method described by Kelley. [28] Binary and ordered categorical outcomes were analysed using mixed effects logistic models analogous to the MMRM, including a random participant intercept implemented in gllamm in Stata 10. Results Of 7086 invitations to potential participants, 1862 (26%) provided consent and proceeded to eligibility screening. Those consenting were more likely to be female (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1. 19), speak English at home (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.15-1.90) have a higher education (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.46-1.92) and a prior doctor's diagnosis of depression (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.22-1.55): these variables were not associated with outcome amongst trial participants. [29] Only 696/1862 (37%) of those consenting met trial inclusion criteria, of whom 116/696 (17%) failed to complete baseline survey or return to website for randomisation and 18/696 (2.5%) withdrew consent before commencing leaving 562/696 (80.5%) who proceeded through to baseline assessment and randomisation (Figure S1). Baseline characteristics were well matched between trial arms with no socio-demographic, or health differences (Table 1). There were no differences in baseline depression severity (PHQ-9 mean difference 0.2; 95%CI; 20.4-0.8) or the other outcome scores between arms (Tables 2 and3). Participants had a mean age of 58 years, the majority were female (61.4%), married or partnered (72.6%), spoke English at home (94.5%) and had an education after basic schooling (72.7%). Over half (53.6%) had had a previous diagnosis of depression and 70% were already diagnosed and treated for existing cardiovascular disease. The remaining 30% had 2 or more other risk factors: obesity, being a current smoker, a strong family history of CVD or aged over 65. Obesity (BMI.30) was common (45.6%) but smoking uncommon (14.2%). The majority, 314/562 (56%) had another comorbid chronic physical health problem including cancer, thrombosis, osteoarthritis, Parkinson's disease, asthma or thyroid disease. Of trial participants, 260/280 (93%) assigned to iCBT and 278/ 282 (99%) assigned to the control arm provided at least one post baseline measure. All participants contributed to the analysis in the ITT modelling approach. Complete post intervention depression scores were available for more of those in the control arm (97%) than those assigned iCBT 76%), (Odds ratio 9.36, 95% CI: 6.36-13.75). Baseline depression severity (PHQ-9 score) was not associated with study dropout overall (Odds ratio = 0.97, p = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.90-1.05) but in the iCBT arm a linear association of baseline depression severity and dropout approached significance (Odds ratio = 0.92, p = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.84-1.001). The direction of the association implies that participants with higher levels of depression at baseline were less likely to withdraw from the trial. There was no depression-attrition association in the control arm. Attrition was not associated with any demographic factor or outcome except that it was more common amongst the small group (n = 31 (5.5%)) who did not speak English as their first language at home. The observed results for all outcomes at baseline and post intervention are presented in Tables 2 and3 and the estimated means and contrasts from the MMRM approach in Table 4. Primary Outcome -Depression Symptom Severity (Tables 2 and4, Figure S2) Participants in both arms showed symptomatic improvement by, on average (observed means) 3.66 (95% CI: 3.05-4.27) points with iCBT and 2.60 points (95%CI 2.05-3.16) in the control group, with a significantly greater decline in the PHQ-9 for iCBT compared to control (1.06; 95%CI: 0.23-1.89; time by arm interaction p = .012). The effect was seen both those being treated for CVD and those just with a higher risk status :the time by condition by CVD treatment interaction was not significant, indicating no reliable differential effects (F test for the interaction is F(3,505.8) = 0.76, p = 0.5078). This difference was slightly less than that hypothesised: 0.22 standard deviations of the mean observed change score. Secondary Outcome -Adherence to Medical and Lifestyle Intervention (Tables 2 and4) Specific adherence scores were available for all participants at baseline and at follow-up for 204/280 (73%) participants in the iCBT arm and 272/282 (96%) participants assigned to the control group. Assignment to iCBT resulted in adherence scores higher by 2.16 points (95% CI: 0.33-3.99). Only 2 participants reported no medical or lifestyle intervention behaviours at all. Tertiary Outcomes (Tables 234) The iCBT resulted in greater anxiety score (GAD-7 [23]) improvement by 2.44 (95%CI: 1.87-3.02) points with iCBT compared to 1.48 (95%CI:0.97-1.99) in the control group with a difference in means of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.19-1.73) points (time by arm interaction p = 0.014). There was a greater proportion engaging in activity sufficient to confer a health benefit post intervention (150 mins over 5 occasions/week); 67% in iCBT vs. 61% in the control group (Odds Ratio 1.91, 95%CI: 1.01-3.61), but no differential improvement in average walking time per day: time by arm interaction (Odds ratio = 1.46, 95% CI: 0.81-2.62), (table 3). Although disability improved slightly in both groups (iCBT 1.08 (95% CI: 0.55-1.61), Control: 0.68 (95% CI: 0.22-1.14) there was no differential advantage for iCBT: (mean difference 0.40 (95% CI: 20.30-1.10), time by arm interaction p = 0.262) or when assessed as cut back days (Odds ratio = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.48-1.41), (table 3).
