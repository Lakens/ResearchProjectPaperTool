Methods Results We first examined the extent to which students experience cyberbullying in order to gain a basic understanding of the issue. In addition to cyberbullying, students' experience of bullying was also investigated considering that adolescences' experience of bullying can inform our understanding of cyberbullying. Overall, close to half of the students were bully victims and about one in four students had been cyberbullied. Over 34 percent of the students had bullied others in the traditional form, and almost 17 percent had bullied others using electronic communication tools. In addition, 53.6 percent of the students reported that they knew someone being cyberbullied. When male and female students' experiences were considering separately, it was found that over 22 percent of males and close to 12 percent of females were cyberbullies. However, 25 percent of males and 25.6 percent of females reported that they were cyberbullied. Table 2 provides details of male and female student reported experience.
Subject and instrument The subjects for this study were randomly selected from three middle schools in a large city in Canada. A total of 264 grade 7-9 students (130 males and 134 females) completed the questionnaire. Among them, only 5.8 percent were ESL students. Further, 75.4 percent of the students were white, 6.4 percent Asian, and about 18 percent were Black, Hispanic, Aboriginal or from other ethic groups (see Table 1 for details). Over half of the students reported above average school grades, while close to 40 percent of them reported average grades. Only a couple of the students reported below average grades. An anonymous survey adapted from previous research (Li, in press) was used which includes two major areas: students' demographic data and their experience related to cyberbullying. A total of 26 questions including the frequency of using computers were analysed to answer the research questions of this study (see Appendix 1 for details of the survey). School Psychology International (2006), Vol. 27(2) Analysis Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to examine gender differences in junior high students' experience of cyberbullying. The statistical package SPSS ( 2004) was used to analyse data. Descriptive statistics were employed to provide background information such as the extent and frequencies of cyberbullying. Further, chi-square tests were used with an alpha level of 0.05 to examine possible gender differences. Do male and female adolescents have different cyberbullying experiences? There was no significant difference between the proportion of male and female adolescents who reported being bullied (χ 2 = (1, n = 256) = 3.50, p = 0.17) or cyberbullied (χ 2 = (1, n = 257) = 0.011, p = 0.91). However, Li: Cyberbullying in Schools males were more likely to bully (χ 2 = (1, n = 258) = 4.83, p = 0.028) and cyberbully (χ 2 = (1, n = 233) = 4.82, p = 0.021) others than were females.
Methods How often did cyberbullying occur? The answer to this question was grouped into two categories: one to three times and more than three times. Among the cybervictims, about 62 percent were cyberbullied one to three times and 37.8 percent were harassed more than three times. No significant gender difference was found in frequencies of cyberbullying victimization (χ 2 = (1, n = 82) = 2.02, p = 0.15). Further, close to 55 percent of cyberbullies harassed others between one to three times and over 45 percent did it more than three times using electronic means. No significant gender difference was found in frequencies of cyberbullying (χ 2 = (1, n = 53) = 1.37, p = 0.24).

Only 64.1 percent of the students believed that adults in schools tried to stop cyberbullying when informed. No significant gender difference was found in student beliefs about this adult involvement in stopping cyberbullying (χ 2 = (1, n = 231) = 1.24, p = 0.54). When cyberbullying occurred, who would tell adults, male or female students? The analysis showed that for the cybervictims, females were more likely to inform adults than males (χ 2 = (1, n = 81) = 6.15, p = 0.012). For the students who knew someone being cyberbullied, only 30.1 percent told adults but no gender difference was found (χ 2 = (1, n = 133) = 0.129, p = 0.72).
