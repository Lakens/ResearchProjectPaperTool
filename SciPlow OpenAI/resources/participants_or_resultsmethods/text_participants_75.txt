Participants
Twenty-two healthy control participants (CO) (12 females) were recruited via advertisements.
They were screened for history of psychiatric illness, head injury, epilepsy, and drug use.
Sixteen (5 females) individuals who met the DSM-IV criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (13 schizophrenia, 3 schizoaffective) were recruited from an outpatient clinic.
All schizophrenic and schizoaffective subjects (SZ) were chronically ill (mean years of illness = 13.4, S.D.
= 7.4).
Exclusion criteria for SZ were multiple diagnoses, head injury, epilepsy, or current drug abuse.
All SZ subjects were taking atypical antipsychotic drugs (risperidone, olanzapine or clozapine).
Demographic information is presented in Table 1.
All participants gave written informed consent as approved by the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board and were paid.
There were no group differences in age (F(1,36) = 1.41, P = n.s.), education (F(1,36)= 0.41, P = n.s.), estimated full-scale IQ (F(1,34) = 0.92, P = n.s.) and handedness measured by the Global Handedness Questionnaire (F(1,36) = 1.96, P = n.s.).
IQ data were missing from two CO subjects, but since the education level was matched, it is unlikely that the two groups differed in general cognitive ability.
