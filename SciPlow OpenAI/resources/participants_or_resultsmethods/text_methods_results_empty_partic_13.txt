Method Participants Participants included middle (97.6%) and high (2.4%) socioeconomic status college students. In the beginning of the study, 693 (239 males and 454 females) subjects were selected and responded to the surveys. However, prior to conducting analyses, 17 subjects were identifi-ed as outliers. All outliers were deleted, leaving 666 cases for the analyses. Th erefore, participants of the study were 666 undergraduate college students (231 males and 435 females) from 15 diff erent programs in the Faculty of Education at Selcuk University, Turkey. Students' ages ranged from 18 to 22 years (M = 19.29, SD = 1.14). One hundred and eighty-one students were freshmen, 254 were sophomores, 120 were juniors and 111 were seniors. Data were collected using the internet users; therefore, convenience sampling was used in this study. Results
Procedure Th e study was started in September, 2007. After preparing the surveys, they were administered to groups in classrooms during the Fall of 2007. Th e author of the current study administered the surveys. Before completing the surveys, participants were informed about the study and signed a consent form to participate. Th e survey required approximately 20 minutes to complete. All data were coded and entered SPSS by student research assistants at the Faculty of Education. Descriptive Statistics In the overall sample (N=666), 22.5% of the students (n=150) reported engaging in cyber bullying at least once, and 55.3% of the students (n=368) reported being victims of cyber bullying at least once in their lifetime. Of the 22.5% of respondents who reported engaging in cyber bullying at least once, 3% (n=20) were identified by the author as a "pure-bully"; that is, someone who is a perpetrator of cyber bullying but has never been bullied. Th e other 19.5% of the 22.5% (n=130) were labeled as "bully-victims" and were both perpetrators and victims of cyber bullying. In the sample, 35.7% of the students (n=238) were labeled as "pure-victims" who never perpetrated cyber bullying, but were themselves bullied. Another 41.7% of students (n=278) reported that they had never engaged in or been exposed to cyber bullying (i.e., "non-bullyvictims" or "bystanders"). When participants were asked if they would engage in cyber bullying in future, 3.5% answered "yes," 15.3% answered "I am not sure," and 81.2% answered "no." Males (M rank=359.05) reported more cyber bullying behavior than females (M rank=319.93), (Mann-Whitney U=44339.50, Z=-3.42, p=.001). As seen in Table 1, while the rate of victims and bully-victims is higher among females than males, the rate of bullying is higher among males than females (χ² (3) =16.64, p=.001). Th e mean order scores was 52.61 at the highest point, and the mean Dominance scores was 43.14 representing the lowest mean score. Table 2 lists the means and standard deviations of the psychological needs reported by males and females. Significant correlations emerged among some of the Need scales of the ACL. Correlation coeff icients ranged from .00 to .52 (see Table 3). As seen in Table 1, while the rate of victims and bully-victims is higher among females than males, the rate of bullying is higher among males than females (χ² (3) =16.64, p=.001).
Instruments Th e survey consisted of three sections. Th e first section consisted of five demographic questions regarding sex, age, department, class year, and socioeconomic level. Th e second section consisted of questions specifically about cyber bullying. Finally, the third section was the Adjective Check List (ACL) (Gough, & Heilbrun, 1983). Inferential Statistics Th e data were examined for normality using normal Q-Q plots, his- As aforementioned, 17 significant outliers were found using standard z values. Cases with a standardized scores in excess of 3.29 (p<.001, twotailed test) were outliers and deleted. Correlations between the variables (r ≤ .90) showed that there was no multicollinearity (Tabachnick, & Fidell, 2007). Psychological Need Diff erences among Bully, Victim, Bully-Victim, and Non-Bully-Victims General Linear Model (GLM) MANOVA show that there are significant diff erences between "pure-victims," "pure-bullies," "bully-victims," and "non-bully-victims" according to the self-reported psychological need scores (Λ=.87,F=2.08,Hypothesis df=45,η²=.046,p=.000). Th ere was no significant interaction between sex and cyber bullying aff iliation on psychological needs (Λ=.93,F=1.04,Hypothesis df=45,η²=.024,p=.398). A Bonferroni multiple comparison test was performed to explore specific diff erences between groups. GLM MANOVA and Bonferroni tests showed that non-bully-victims (M=48.22, SD=10.98) reported significantly more endurance than purevictims (M=45.78, SD=10.18) and bully-victims (M=43.43, SD=11.64), (F (3, 658)=6.55, p=.000). SDi=11.83;Mn=46.42,SDn=10.33) selfreported significantly less intraception and nurturance than both pure victims (Mi=49.12, SDi=10.62; Mn=49.92,SDi=10.82;Mn=50.66,SDn=11.61), (F (3, 658)=7.10 and 5.81, p=.001, respectively).
Cyber Bullying Questions After the demographic questions, students were provided with an operational definition of cyber bullying. Belsey's (2008) definition with a set of examples was used to help students understand what is meant by cyber bullying. Following the definition, the following questions were asked to students: Based on the definition of cyber bullying provided above (1) "Have you ever engaged in cyber bullying before today?" (1-Never, 2-One time, 3-Between two-four times, 4-Five or more times). ( 2) "Have you ever been exposed to cyber bullying?" (1-Never, 2-One time, 3-Between two-four times, 4-Five or more times). ( 3) "Would you engage in cyber bullying as a bully in the future?" (1-Yes, 2-I am not sure, 3-No). Two expert reviewers with PhDs examined the items for ambiguity and the overall quality of the instrument. Th e instruments were administered in Turkish. Bully Non-bully-victims (M=47.03, SD=15.74) showed significantly more aff iliation than bully-victims (M=39.46, SD=18.32), (F (3, 658)=6.32, p=.000). Finally, bully-victims (M=52.42, SD=10.56) self-reported significantly more aggression than both pure-victims (M=47.85, SD=9.68) and nonbully-victims (M=48.59, SD=9.86), (F (3, 658)=7.96, p=.000). No significant diff erences among groups in terms of other psychological needs were found.
The Adjective Check List (ACL) Th e ACL was originally developed in 1949 by Gough and was published in 1965 (Gough, & Heilbrun, 1983). Gough and Heilbrun developed the ACL to assist in identifying personal traits of an individual by analyzing their social needs. By analyzing the individual's social needs, the individual's motivations and modus operandi also become apparent (Reljic, 2007). Th e ACL consists of 300 adjectives arranged in alphabetical order. Respondents are asked to endorse adjectives they believe are descriptive of their personality. Th e 300 adjectives are divided into 37 scales: 4 Modus Operandi scales, 15 Need scales, 9 Topical scales, 5 Transactional Analysis scales, and 4 Origence-Intelligence scales (Gough, & Heilbrun, 1983;Reljic, 2007). Th e ACL is a pencil and paper test that was completed in approximately 15-20 minutes. Th e normative sample used to develop the ACL included 5236 male and 4144 female adults, high school students, college students, medical students, graduate students, psychiatric patients, and delinquents from 37 states in the United States (Reljic, 2007). Th e ACL was translated and adapted to Turkish by Savran (Savran, 1993). Savran performed reliability and validity analyses of the ACL on Turkish university students (n=300). Th e internal consistency reliability coeff icients were between .36 and .84 for the 37 subscales (Savran, 1993). Th e Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS; Edwards, Abbott, & Klockars, 1972;Kuzgun, 1985) was used as a criterion measure to measure the validity of the analyses. Th e mean of correlation coeff icients was .48 (p<.05). Subscales of the ACL were found correlated with each other (between .20 and .80) (Savran, 1993). Savran also conducted norm study of the ACL on Turkish people from diff erent age, education and socioeconomic level (n=700). Results showed that the ACL was a valid and reliable instrument for Turkish population. Th e ACL gives standard scores for Turkish people (Savran, 1993). Stepwise Regression Analysis: Psychological Needs as Predictors of Cyber bullying To examine the predictive power of psychological needs on cyber bullying, a stepwise regression analysis was performed using SPSS 15. In the first analysis, engagement in cyber bullying (as perpetrator) was the dependent variable and the 15 need scales were the independent variables. Th ree models were extracted as the result of analysis. In the first model, intraception (β=-.18) was the only variable that predicted engagement in cyber bullying (R²=.031, F(1, 664)=22.07, p=.000). In the second model, intraception (β=-.14) and aggression (β=.12) predicted engagement in cyber bullying (R²=.042, F(2, 663)=15.56, p=.000). In the third model, intraception (β=-.12), aggression (β=.14) and succorance (β=.10) predicted engagement in cyber bullying (R²=.049, F(3, 662)=12.53, p=.000). In the second analysis, exposure to cyber bullying (as victim) was the dependent variable and the fifteen need scales were independent variables. Four models were extracted as the result of analysis. In the first model, endurance (β=-.13) predicted exposure to cyber bullying (R²=.017, F(1, 664)=12.21, p=.001). In the second model, endurance (β=-.12) and aff iliation (β=-.12) predicted exposure to cyber bullying (R²=.028, F(2, 663)=10.70, p=.000). In the third model, endurance (β=-.09), aff iliation (β=-.14) and change (β=.10) predicted exposure to cyber bullying (R²=.036, F(3, 662)=9.17, p=.000). In the fourth model, endurance (β=-.13), aff iliation (β=-.16), change (β=.11) and order (β=.10) predicted exposure to cyber bullying (R²=.041, F(4, 661)=8.08, p=.000). In the third analysis, the probability of engaging in cyber bullying in the future (as perpetrator) was the dependent variable and the 15 need scales were independent variables. Four models were extracted. In the first model, aggression (β=.17) predicted possible future engagement in cyber bullying (R²=.026, F(1, 664)=18.93, p=.000). In the second model, aggression (β=.14) and aff iliation (β=-.12) predicted possible future engagement in cyber bullying (R²=.039, F(2, 663)=14.34, p=.000). In the third model, aggression (β=.14), aff iliation (β=-.10) and heterosexuality (β=-.08) predicted possible future engagement in cyber bullying (R²=.044, F(3, 662)=11.20, p=.000). In the fourth model, aggression (β=.14), aff iliation (β=-.09), heterosexuality (β=-.08) and endurance (β=-.08) predicted possible future engagement in cyber bullying (R²=.049, F(4, 661)=9.49, p=.000). In addition to psychological needs, previous engagement in cyber bullying (β=.51) and exposure to cyber bullying (β=.10) predicted the likelihood of being a cyber bully in the future (R²=.31, F(2, 663)=150.82, p=.000).
The Need Scales of the ACL Fifteen need scales were used in the current study (Gough, & Heilbrun, 1983, 2008). Th ese include: Achievement: Striving to be outstanding in pursuits of socially recognized significance. Dominance: Seeking and sustaining leadership roles in groups or being infl uential and controlling in individual relationships. Endurance: Persisting in any task undertaken. Order: Placing special emphasis on neatness, organization, and planning in one's activities. Intraception: Engaging in attempts to understand one's own behavior or the behavior of others. Nurturance: Engaging in behaviors which extend material or emotional benefits to others. Aff iliation: Seeking and sustaining numerous personal friendships. Heterosexuality: Seeking the company of and deriving emotional satisfaction from interactions with opposite sex-peers. Exhibition: Behaving in such a way as to elicit the immediate attention of others. Autonomy: Acting independently of others or of social values and expectations. Aggression: Engaging in behaviors which attack or hurt others. Change: Seeking novelty of experience and avoiding routine. Succorance: Soliciting sympathy, aff ection, and emotional support from others. Abasement: Expressing feelings of inferiority through self-criticism, guilt, or social impotence. Deference: Seeking and sustaining subordinate roles in relationships with others. Results
Data Analysis Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to examine the relations and interaction between cyber bullying and the psychological needs subscales of the ACL. Th e statistical package, SPSS 15 for Windows (SPSS for Windows, 2006) was used to analyze the data. Descriptive Statistics In the overall sample (N=666), 22.5% of the students (n=150) reported engaging in cyber bullying at least once, and 55.3% of the students (n=368) reported being victims of cyber bullying at least once in their lifetime. Of the 22.5% of respondents who reported engaging in cyber bullying at least once, 3% (n=20) were identified by the author as a "pure-bully"; that is, someone who is a perpetrator of cyber bullying but has never been bullied. Th e other 19.5% of the 22.5% (n=130) were labeled as "bully-victims" and were both perpetrators and victims of cyber bullying. In the sample, 35.7% of the students (n=238) were labeled as "pure-victims" who never perpetrated cyber bullying, but were themselves bullied. Another 41.7% of students (n=278) reported that they had never engaged in or been exposed to cyber bullying (i.e., "non-bullyvictims" or "bystanders"). When participants were asked if they would engage in cyber bullying in future, 3.5% answered "yes," 15.3% answered "I am not sure," and 81.2% answered "no." Males (M rank=359.05) reported more cyber bullying behavior than females (M rank=319.93), (Mann-Whitney U=44339.50, Z=-3.42, p=.001). As seen in Table 1, while the rate of victims and bully-victims is higher among females than males, the rate of bullying is higher among males than females (χ² (3) =16.64, p=.001). Th e mean order scores was 52.61 at the highest point, and the mean Dominance scores was 43.14 representing the lowest mean score. Table 2 lists the means and standard deviations of the psychological needs reported by males and females. Significant correlations emerged among some of the Need scales of the ACL. Correlation coeff icients ranged from .00 to .52 (see Table 3). As seen in Table 1, while the rate of victims and bully-victims is higher among females than males, the rate of bullying is higher among males than females (χ² (3) =16.64, p=.001).
