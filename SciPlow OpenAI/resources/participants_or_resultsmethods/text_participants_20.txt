Participants
Two samples from Australian schools were used in the questionnaire development and analysis of factor structure (see Figure 1).
For the questionnaire development phase, 647 (301 male, 46.5%; 346 female, 53.5%) children and adolescents aged between 8 years and 15 years (M ϭ 12.38, SD ϭ 1.69) from nine schools (66% secondary school level) were recruited in 2004.
The participants provided student and parental consent and completed the first version of the PECK.
This sample comprised 20% of the total student sample initially approached to participate in the study.
The students self-identified their ethnicity, with the most common groups being Anglo-Saxon (83.5%), East Asian (9.3%), West Asian (2.7%) and Middle Eastern (1.5%).
In 2006, an independent second sample of 218 (131 male, 60.1%; 87 female, 39.9%) children and adolescents was recruited.
These children were recruited from five schools (44% secondary school level) and were aged between 9 years and 16 years (M ϭ 11.8, SD ϭ 1.64).
The participants provided student and parental consent to complete the PECK, as well as a number of other self-report questionnaires.
The students self-identified their ethnicity, with the most common groups being Anglo-Saxon (67%), East Asian (11.5%), Mediterranean (6.0%) and Middle Eastern (5.5%).
This sample comprised 23% of the total student sample initially approached to participate in the study.
