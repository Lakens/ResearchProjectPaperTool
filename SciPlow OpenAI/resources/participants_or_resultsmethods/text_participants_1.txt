Participants
The pre-test (T 0 ) questionnaire was completed by 142 women, after which 63 women were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 79 to the control group.
The first post-test (T 1 ) questionnaire, at about six weeks after T 0 (i.e., immediately after the end of the course), was completed by 46 women in the intervention group and 73 in the control group, and the second post-test (T 2 ) questionnaire, at about six months after T 0 , was completed by 36 women in the intervention group and 62 controls.
A total of 13 women dropped out before the end of the intervention.
The reasons for drop-out were diverse.
Some women felt that the intervention was too much of a mental or physical burden; some felt that they did not fit in with the group; and others felt that they did not learn anything new from the intervention.
Four other women did not even attend the first meeting.
When they were phoned by the researcher they were either ill, had doubts about participation or were unable to schedule the intervention in their agenda.
Another group of drop-outs consisted of women who did not return the first posttest (T 1 ) questionnaire (0 intervention, 6 controls) or the second post-test (T 2 ) questionnaire (10 intervention, 11 controls).
The unequal drop-out rates could have affected the reliability of the statistical analysis.
We therefore tested the equality of variances.
All values were non-significant, indicating that the unequal group-sizes were no problem.
Table I shows that there was no significant difference between the baseline characteristics of the 46 women who completed the intervention, and also completed the T 1 questionnaire, and the baseline characteristics of the 73 women in the control group who were still participating at T 1 .
Although the controls tended to be somewhat older than the women in the intervention group, this difference was not significant, t(1, 117) ¼ 1.75, p ¼ 0.06.
In addition, no significant differences were found with regard to marital status, 2 ¼ 5.08, p ¼ 0.17, children (children or no children), 2 ¼ 2.92, p ¼ 0.09, or level of physical functioning, t(1,116) ¼ À1.00, p ¼ 0.32.
Analyses of variance also showed no significant differences in the scores for the SMAS-30, the SPF-IL, or the loneliness questionnaire at T 0 between the 98 women who completed all three questionnaires and the 44 women who dropped out, suggesting that there was no selection bias with respect to these measures.
Although the drop-outs seemed to score somewhat lower (M ¼ 42.3) on the SMAS-30, F(1, 137) ¼ 3.72, p ¼ 0.06 than those who completed all questionnaires (M ¼ 46.6), this difference was not significant.
