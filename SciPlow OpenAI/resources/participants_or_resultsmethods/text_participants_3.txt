Participants
A total of 39 participants completed the intake phase of the study, with 32 finishing the entire treatment.
There were no significant differences between completers and non-completers on various demographic factors (e.g., education, age, marital status) and other pre-treatment variables of interest (e.g., agency, pathways, hope, depressive symptoms).
Five of the noncompleters had been assigned to the treatment group and two of the noncompleters had been assigned to the wait-list control group.
Thus, the rate of completion for the hope treatment group was 78% and the rate of completion for the wait-list control was 88%.
The remainder of the data are presented for protocol completers.
In this predominantly Caucasian (94%) female (74%) sample, the average participant was 49 years old (SD=7.67; range=32-64), had completed 16 years of education (SD=1.97, range 12-19 years), and was married (60%).
Approximately 81% of the participants previously had completed some form of psychological treatment, and 37.5% currently were involved in some form of psychological treatment.
Three of the participants reported a previous psychiatric hospitalization, but none of the participants indicated current suicidal ideation.
Based on SCID-I (First et al., 1995) data, diagnostic criteria was met for current episodes of recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD; n=6), social phobia (n=4), specific phobia (n=3), recurrent MDD in partial remission (n=1), MDD single episode (n=1), dysthymic disorder (n=1), panic disorder (n=1), and generalized anxiety disorder (n=1).
Although some participants met criteria for multiple DSM-IV disorders, here we only list current disorders that were described by the participants as the primary diagnosis.
Thus, the preceding categories are mutually exclusive, with 18 participants meeting criteria for at least one Axis-I disorder and 14 participants not meeting criteria for any Axis-I disorder.
