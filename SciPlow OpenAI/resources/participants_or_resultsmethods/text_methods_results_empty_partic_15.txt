METHOD Participants The sample consisted of 1,416 adolescents living in Cyprus (50.1% girls; aged 11-14 years at the first assessment, M age ¼ 12.89, SD ¼ 0.78). Following approval of the study by the Cyprus Ministry of Education, 13 middle schools were randomly selected (12 public, 1 private) from three of the four school districts (Lefkosia, Larnaca, Lemeso) in Cyprus. After approval of the study by the school boards, students were given an informed consent form for their parents to sign. In the classroom, students were informed about the study and were also informed about their rights as participants. Only students with parental consent were permitted to participate in the study. Group assessments were conducted with questionnaires being administered by trained research assistants. Prior to the first assessment, parental consent was obtained from 1,513 students, and these students completed questionnaires administered during Year 1. At the second assessment one year later, 93.59% (n ¼ 1,416) of the original sample of students participated. Attrition was due to an inability to contact students who had moved away or transferred to a different school. The sample was diverse in terms of parental educational levels (20.1% did not complete high school, 46% had a highschool education, and 33.9% had a university degree) and parental marital status (7.2% of the families consisted of one-parent households). RESULTS
Measures Psychopathic traits. CU traits were measured with the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU; Frick, 2004), which is a 24-item selfreport scale. Narcissism (seven items) and impulsivity (five items) were measured with the Antisocial Process Screening Device-Youth report (APSD; Frick & Hare, 2001). All the items were placed on a 4-point scale (from 0 ¼ Not at all true to 3 ¼ Definitely true). The items measuring CU traits (a ¼ .80; e.g., ''I do not show my emotions to others''), narcissism (a ¼ .70; e.g., ''I act charming or nice to get things I want''), and impulsivity (a ¼ .73; e.g., ''I do not plan ahead or I leave things until the last moment'') formed internally consistent scales. Previous research has provided evidence for the validity of the self-reported versions of the ICU and APSD in community and high risk samples in Cyprus, Germany and the USA (Fanti et al., 2009;Kimonis, Frick, Skeem, Marsee, Cruise, Munoz, Aucoin, & Morris, 2008;Munoz & Frick, 2007). Descriptive statistics Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics of the study's variables measured at Times 1 and 2 and the correlations among the variables under investigation. School-bullying and victimization and cyberbullying and victimization were correlated cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Furthermore, cyberbullying and cyber-victimization were positively associated with the three dimensions of psychopathy and MVE, while they were negatively correlated with family and friend social support, providing initial evidence of potential risk and protective variables. According to independent samples t-tests, boys scored higher than girls on school-bullying, t(1415) ¼ 8.04, p 5 .001, and victimization, t(1415) ¼ 4.90, p 5 .001, CU traits, t(1415) ¼ 8.06, p 5 .001, narcissism, t(1415) ¼ 6.65, p 5 .001, impulsivity, t(1415) ¼ 16.03, p 5 .001, MVE, t(1415) ¼ 16.70, p 5 .001, Time 1 cyberbullying, t(1415) ¼ 7.39, p 5 .001, and cyber-victimization, t(1415) ¼ 4.55, p 5 .001, Time 2 cyberbullying, t(1415) ¼ 6.28, p 5 .001, and cyber-victimization, t(1415) ¼ 3.33, p ¼ .001, and lower on friend social support, t(1415) ¼ 9.03, p 5 .001. According to paired-sample t-tests, there was a significant mean-level increase in cybervictimization from Year 1 to Year 2, t(1415) ¼ 2.40, p 5 .05. No change in cyberbullying was identified, t(1415) ¼ 0.83, p ¼ .41.
MVE. Participants were asked five questions regarding the average time per week (ranging from 0 to more than 20 hours per week) they spent watching violent television programmes, violent scenes on the internet, violent movies (at home or in movie theatres), and playing violent video games (a ¼ .89). This questionnaire was based on prior work by Funk, Bechtoldt-Baldacci, Pasold, and Baumgartner (2004). Supportive social relations. These were assessed with the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS; Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, & Farley, 1988). This instrument was used to measure supportive relationships within three contexts: family (a ¼ .82; e.g., ''I get the emotional support I need from my family''), friend (a ¼ .80; e.g., ''I can count on my friend when things go wrong''), and school (a ¼ .87; e.g., ''The staff at my school provides me the support and encouragement that I need''). The participants respondent on a 4-point scale (from 0 ¼ Not at all true to 3 ¼ Definitely true). Prior work has provided evidence that the MSPSS is a valid and reliable measure of perceived social support during adolescence (Canty-Mitchell & Zimet, 2000). Bullying, victimization, cyberbullying, and cyber-victimization. The Student Survey of Bullying Behaviour-Revised (SSBB-R; Varjas, Meyers, & Hunt, 2006) was administered at Years 1 and 2 to measure school-bullying, school-victimization, cyberbullying and cyber-victimization. Participants indicated whether they had engaged in different types of bullying or how often they experienced different types of victimization on an ordinal scale of: never, once or twice a year, monthly, weekly, or daily. The SSBB-R includes 12 items assessing school-bullying (a ¼ .89; e.g., ''How often do you pick on younger, smaller, less powerful, or less popular kids by hitting or kicking them?''), 12 items assessing school victimization (a ¼ .90; e.g., ''How often do older, bigger, more popular or more powerful kids pick on you by hitting or kicking you?''), four items assessing cyberbullying (a ¼ .86), and four items assessing cyber-victimization (a ¼ .91). To asses cyberbullying and cyber-victimization participants were asked how often they sent or received a threatening or harassing: (1) e-mail; (2) instant message; (3) message in a chat room or social networking sites; and (4) Short Text Message (SMS). Previous research using the SSBB-R successfully measured school-bullying, school-victimization, cyberbullying, and cyber-victimization in community samples of adolescents in Cyprus and the USA (Fanti et al., 2009;Hunt, Meyers, Jarrett, & Neel, 2005;Varjas et al., 2006). Hierarchical linear regressions Table 2 shows the hierarchical linear regression analyses with cyberbullying and cyber-victimization as the outcomes. In step 1, we controlled for demographics-gender (coded with 0 for boys and 1 for girls), and parental marital status (coded with 0 for one-parent families and 1 for intact families). In step 2 we controlled for Year 1 cyberbullying, cybervictimization, school-bullying and school victimization. Step 3 included all the risk variables (MVE, CU traits, narcissism, and impulsivity) and step 4 the protective variables (family, friend, and school social support). Subsequent steps included the two-way and three-way interactions between social-support variables. Interactions between the demographic variables (gender and parental marital status) and all the variables under investigation as well as the two-and three-way interactions between social support variables were also examined. To probe the interaction effects we used the procedures described by Aiken and West (1991). All variables were centred to facilitate ease of interpretation of the significant interaction terms. Table 2 only reports the significant interactions. Cyberbullying. Table 2 shows the hierarchical linear regression analysis with cyberbullying as the dependent variable. In the first step of independent variables, gender was significantly associated with cyberbullying, suggesting that boys were at higher risk for exhibiting cyberbullying. School-bullying and cyberbullying at Year 1 predicted cyberbullying one year later. MVE and CU traits were each positively related to changes in cyberbullying above and beyond the variables entered in steps 1 and 2. Furthermore, family social support was related to decreases in cyberbullying a year later after taking into account all the risk factors. No significant interactions were found. Cyber-victimization. According to Table 2, boys and adolescents living in single-parent households were more likely to be cyber-victimized. Step 2 suggested that Time 1 cyber-victimization and school victimization were positively related to Year 2 cyber-victimization. MVE was the only risk factor that predicted changes in cyber-victimization, and family social support was the only environmental protective factor negatively related to cyber-victimization. There were two significant two-way interactions, parental marital status 6 family social support and family 6 friend social support, predicting Year 2 cyber-victimization. Furthermore, there was a significant three-way interaction between parental marital status, family, and friend social support. As a result, the two-way interactions were conditional on the significant three-way interaction, and thus only the higher order three-way interaction needs to be interpreted (Aiken & West, 1991). The results of the three-way interaction suggested that the family by friend social support interaction was only significant for single-parent households (b family 6 b friend ¼ 0.29, p 5 .05), but not for intact households (b family 6 b friend ¼ 0.03, p ¼ .38). The significant interaction is depicted in Figure 1. The high and low points in the graphs represent values of one standard deviation above and below the mean. According to the graph, family social support was associated with decreases in cyber-victimization at low levels of friend social support (b ¼ 70.40, p 5 .01), but not for high levels of friend social support (b ¼ 70.17, p ¼ .29). Thus, the stronger relation between family social support and cyber-victimization was obtained for adolescents living in single-parent households who reported the lowest levels of friend social support. This finding further suggests that at higher levels of family support, low friend support was not as detrimental for the development of cyber-victimization. In addition, low family support coupled with low friend support predicted the highest levels of cybervictimization.
