Participants
Participants were 56 adults (18-60 years, 42 females and 14 males, mean age ¼ 42.68) from a normal (non-clinical) population, i.e., scores on the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) all fell within the normal range of psychopathology.
The 56 participants were randomly assigned to Group 1 (Coaching Group, n ¼ 28) or the Waitlist Control Group (Control Group, n ¼ 28).
All participants completed the relevant self-report measures at Time 1 (pre-Group 1) and Time 2 (post-Group 1).
Only participants in the Coaching Group completed measures at Time 3, Time 4, and Time 5 (see Table I).
Of the 56 participants assigned to take part in the study, six participants (three control, three experimental) withdrew from the study prior to completion of the initial intervention (before Time 2).
By Time 5, seven experimental participants withdrew from the study leaving 18 participants in Group 1 for the final analysis examining changes over time.
