Method Results
Participants and procedure An online survey was carried out among 1169 Year 11 students in 20 of the 27 secondary schools in the Otago region of NZ; this represented 85% of the 1370 in the sampling frame. To obtain a clear picture of the situation in rural schools, there was some over-sampling of rural students, with a final sample of 378 rural students (from schools with a town population less than 10 000) and 791 urban students. A cluster sample design of classes within schools was used to recruit individual students. Fifty five percent of the participants were female, with an average age of 15.7 AE 0.4 years. The majority (87%) identified as being NZ European and 10% identified as M aori (Tangata Whenua or the indigenous people of NZ). Ethical approval was received from the Otago University Human Ethics Committee. Surveys were administered by LM during class time over the last three terms of the academic year in 2005, and took on average 30 minutes to complete. Prevalence of bullying behaviours Overall 47% of the sample, 45% of the girls and 50% of the boys, had been bullied ''sometimes or often'' during the current school year, a non-significant difference (p ¼ 0.11). Table 1 shows the reported prevalences for bullying. The most common forms were teasing/name calling (29%), having rumours passed around (22%), being excluded (19%), being physically hurt (15%) and having unwanted text messages sent to them (11%). Boys were significantly more likely than girls to experience physical bullying, and teasing/name calling (p < 0.001). Girls were more likely to experience unwanted text messages (p ¼ 0.002). While most students reported that they had rarely or never bullied other students, 37% did report having bullied others ''sometimes or often''. Such bullying was carried out significantly more by boys than girls (45% versus 28% respectively, p < 0.001). Table 1 also shows the types of bullying perpetrated. The most common forms of bullying were teasing/name calling (24%), excluding others from groups (18%), physical bullying (15%), passing rumours (9%), and unwanted texting (7%). Boys were significantly more likely than girls to bully through exclusion (p ¼ 0.004), physical bullying (p < 0.001), and teasing/name calling (p < 0.001).
Measures Participants reported the frequency with which they themselves had both experienced and carried out each of the following five bullying behaviours ''this year at school'': excluding, physically hurting, teasing/name calling, rumours and texting (Nairn & Smith, 2002). Item responses were on a 4-point scale with 1 ¼ often and 4 ¼ never. Students were also asked ''How often do you feel safe at school?'' with responses dichotomised into ''very often or often'' and ''sometimes, rarely or never'', and ''During the past 30 days, on how many days did you NOT go to school because you felt you would be unsafe at school or on your way to or from school?'' (YRBS -Centre for Disease Control & Prevention, 2003). The relationship between texting and other forms of bullying As shown in Table 2, students who experienced text bullying were also significantly more likely to experience every other form of traditional bullying, regardless of gender. For example, boys who were sent unwanted text messages ''sometimes or often,'' were nearly seventeen times more likely to have been teased and called names than boys who had been text bullied ''rarely or never''. Girls sent unwanted text messages ''sometimes or often'' were nearly nine times more likely to have been rumoured about than girls who had been text bullied less often. Similarly, students who bully others through text messaging were also significantly more likely to bully through other more traditional forms, regardless of gender (Table 2). These relationships between texting and other forms of bullying appeared to be stronger for boys than girls.
Data analysis The distributions for each of the 5 bullying behaviours are described for boys and girls separately. We used survey commands in STATA to obtain correct standard errors to examine gender differences in bullying (Stata Corporation, 2003). STATA reports the association as an F-test rather than c 2 . However to avoid confusion we report the significance of these differences in terms of p-values. Logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between text bullying and traditional bullying. This seemed appropriate as we were interested in the association between these two forms of bullying. Lastly, we used logistic regression to examine the relationship between text bullying (independent variable), and safety at school (dependent variable), again presupposing that feeling less safe would be an outcome of being text bullied, rather than the reverse. For these analyses the bullying variables were dichotomised as ''sometimes or often'' versus ''never or rarely''. Text bullying and feeling safe at school Logistic regression analyses showed that girls and boys who were text bullied were significantly more likely to feel unsafe at school compared with students who were not text bullied (girls OR ¼ 3.1, CI: 1.9-5.2, p < 0.001; boys OR ¼ 4.7, CI: 2.3-10.1, p < 0.001). They were also more likely to have missed school in the past month due to feeling unsafe (girls OR ¼ 12.1, CI: 4.3-33.8, p < 0.001; boys OR¼ 4.1 CI: 1.1-15.2, p < 0.05). Boys who text bullied others were nearly twice as likely to feel unsafe at school (OR ¼ 1.7, CI: 1.0-2.8, p < 0.05), and girls were six times more likely to have missed school in the past month due to feeling unsafe (OR ¼ 6.1, CI: 2.5-14.5, p < 0.001).
