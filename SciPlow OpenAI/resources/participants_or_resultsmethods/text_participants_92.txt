Participants
The study was conducted in a large government agency in Australia, which had approximately 950 employees at the time of the study.
The sample (N = 50) represented the diversity of the organization, including both customer service and processing employees (e.g., call centre, branch staff) and corporate employees (e.g., HR, marketing and communications.
The majority of the sample were female (73 %), with a mean age of 39.7 years (SD = 10.0 years; range = 21-57 years).
Participants were permanently employed, working mostly full-time (94.6 %), on average, 38.8 (SD = 5.8) hours per week, with a mean tenure of 8.9 (SD = 10.6) years.
Participants' flow through the study, as well as the research procedure, is illustrated in Fig.
1.
As shown, 13 employees (26 %) did not complete the time 2 survey.
Of these, four did not complete the survey due to their resignation from the organization prior to the second wave of data collection (all from state headquarters; two from each experimental group).
Eight were branch staff and five (one, excluding those who resigned) were state headquarters employees.
Informal discussions with branch managers indicated that branch staff had been too busy to complete the time 2 survey.
Only minimal attrition occurred at times 3 and 4.
However, due to the losses at time 2, only 23 participants completed all four outcome evaluation surveys (10 control group; 13 intervention group).
