METHOD Twenty-three consecutive out-patients satisfying the criteria described below, who had been referred to and treated in the Affective Disorders Program of the University of Bologna School of Medicine in Italy, were enrolled in this study. The patients' diagnoses were established by the consensus of a psychiatrist (G.A.F.) and a clinical psychologist (C.R.) independently using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (Endicott & Spitzer, 1978). Subjects had to meet the following criteria: (1) a current DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) diagnosis of major depressive disorder, or panic disorder with agoraphobia, or social phobia, or generalized anxiety disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder; (2) no history of active drug or alcohol abuse or dependence or of personality disorder according to DSM-IV criteria; (3) no history of bipolar illness or antecedent dysthymia; (4) no active medical illness; and (5) successful response to treatment administered by two psychiatrists (S.G. and S.C.) according to standardized protocols (Fava et al. 1989, Fava et al., 1994, Fava et al., 1995, Fava et al., 1996 b). These protocols involved the use of antidepressant drugs in the setting of major depressive illness (Fava et al. 1994) and behavioral psychotherapy based on exposure (Fava et al. 1989, Fava et al., 1995, Fava et al., 1996 b) in anxiety disorders. Duration of treatment of mood and anxiety disorders ranged between 3 and 5 months. After treatment, all patients were assessed by the same clinical psychologist who had evaluated them on intake, but who did not take part in the treatment. Only the patients rated as 'better' or 'much better' according to Kellner's global scale of improvement (Kellner, 1972) were included in the study. These 23 patients were screened from a sample of 31 patients initially evaluated. The clinical psychologist then administered a modified version of the Paykel's Clinical Interview for Depression (Paykel, 1985). This interview covered 21 symptom areas, with a total score potentially ranging from 21 to 147, as described in detail elsewhere (Fava et al. 1994). It has been found to be a suitable instrument for evaluating both prodromal and residual symptoms in affective disorders (Fava & Kellner, 1991; Fava, 1996). In the current protocol, a residual symptom was scored as present when a rating of at least 3 on the 7-point scales of the interview was assigned. Only three of the 23 patients screened had no residual symptoms according to this method of rating, and they were excluded from further participation in the study. In addition to the Clinical Interview for Depression (CID), two self-rating scales were administered to the remaining 20 patients. One was Ryff's Scales of Psychological Well-Being (PWB) (Ryff, 1989), an 84-item inventory that covers six areas of well-being: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, self-acceptance. Subjects respond with a six-point format ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Responses to negatively scored items are reversed in the final scoring procedure so that high scores indicate high self-rating on the dimension assessed. Each scale score may range from 0 to 14. The other instrument was Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (SQ) (Fava et al. 1983; Kellner, 1987), a 92-item self-rating scale that yields four scales of distress (anxiety, depression, somatization, and hostilityirritability) and four scales of well-being (relaxation, contentment, physical well-being, and friendliness). Each symptom scale score may range from 0 to 17; each well-being scale score from 0 to 6. The 20 patients were then randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: (1) well-being therapy; or (2) cognitive-behavioral treatment of residual symptoms. In both cases, treatment consisted of eight 40 min sessions once every other week. The same psychiatrist (G.A.F.) was involved in both treatment groups. In well-being therapy, patients were asked to report only the episodes of well-being, rated on a 0-100 scale, in a diary. The initial two sessions were simply concerned with identifying and setting into a situational context such episodes, no matter how short-lived they were. Subsequent work (3rd to 5th sessions) -using techniques derived from both Ellis & Harper rational-emotive therapy (1961) and cognitive therapy (Beck et al. 1979) -was aimed to identifying automatic thoughts and beliefs leading to premature interruption of well-being. In the final sessions (6th to 8th), patients were assessed according to Ryff's dimensions of well-being (Ryff, 1989; Ryff & Singer, 1996), and specific impairments were focus of attention. For instance, low scorers on the dimension of personal growth have a sense of personal stagnation; lack a sense of improvement or expansion over time; feel bored and uninterested with life; and feel unable to develop new attitudes or behaviors. High scorers, on the contrary, have a feeling of continued development; see themselves as growing and expanding; are open to new experiences; have a sense of realizing their potential; and see improvement in themselves and their behavior over time (Ryff & Singer, 1996). The goal of the therapist then becomes to guide the patient through this transition. Furthermore, in behavioral terms, mastery and pleasure tasks as well as exposure to feared situations, were encouraged. Such behavioral techniques were used also in patients treated with cognitive-behavioral treatment of residual symptoms. Cognitive therapy was conducted as described by Beck et al. (1979; Beck & Emery, 1985). Its focus, however, was on psychological distress, and identifying and modifying negative automatic thoughts and beliefs underlying it. Ten patients were assigned to each treatment group. The patients assigned to well-being therapy (WBT) had a mean age of 31n3 (SD l 7n0) years. There were four males and six females. Four patients were married. Eight belonged to the middle-upper social class and two to the working class, according to Goldthorpe & Hope's (1974) occupational classification. All patients had completed at least 13 years of education. Psychiatric diagnoses were as follows: major depressive disorder (2 patients), panic disorder associated with agoraphobia (4), social phobia (2), generalized anxiety disorder (1), obsessive-compulsive disorder (1). Their mean duration of illness was 14n7 (SD l 14n3) months. The 10 patients assigned to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) had a mean age of 25n5 (SD l 6n1) years. Five were women and three were married. Seven patients belonged to the middle-upper social class and nine had completed at least 13 years of education. Psychiatric diagnoses were as follows: major depressive disorder (1 patient), panic disorder associated with agoraphobia

Eight belonged to the middle-upper social class and two to the working class, according to Goldthorpe & Hope's occupational classification. All patients had completed at least 13 years of education. Psychiatric diagnoses were as follows: major depressive disorder (2 patients), panic disorder associated with agoraphobia (4), social phobia (2), generalized anxiety disorder (1), obsessive-compulsive disorder (1). Their mean duration of illness was 14.7 (SD 14.3) months. The 10 patients assigned to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) had a mean age of 25.5 (SD 6.1) years. Five were women and three were married. Seven patients belonged to the middle-upper social class and nine had completed at least 13 years of education. Psychiatric diagnoses were as follows: major depressive disorder (1 patient), panic disorder associated with agoraphobia (3), social phobia (4), generalized anxiety disorder (1), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (1). Their mean duration of illness was 15.0 (SD 12.4) months. At the time of the first assessment, the three depressed patients were taking antidepressant drugs (amitriptyline 200 mg daily in two cases and fluoxetine 20 mg daily in one case). Furthermore, five of the 17 patients with anxiety disorders were taking benzodiazepines (lorazepam or clonazepam at low doses). All patients with anxiety disorders had received behavioral psychotherapy based on exposure; in obsessive-compulsive disorder exposure was associated with response prevention. The patients with major depression and panic disorder were in stage 3 of their illness. Psychotropic drugs were successfully tapered and discontinued in the course of treatment, except for the two patients taking lorazepam (one per each group). Treatment integrity was checked by taping eight randomly selected sessions, four involving well-being therapy and four cognitive-behavioral treatment of residual symptoms
