Participants
Twenty-six outpatients at the University of Chicago Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation (UCCPR) participated in the study. All subjects met the criteria for schizophrenia based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Patient version (SCID-P; Spitzer et al., 1995) and a chart review. The SCID-P was administered by research assistants trained to a kappa of at least 0.70 with consensus criteria from the UC-CPR.

Subjects were excluded if they had a chart history of neurological disorder or developmental disability, corrected vision of less than 20/30 on the Snellen Eye Chart, a reading level below the third grade as measured by the Wide Range Achievement Test - Revised (WRAT), or evidence of substance abuse in the past 6 months as determined by the SCID-P.

The participants had a mean age of 33.4 years (SD = 9.7), had been previously hospitalized an average of 4.8 times (SD = 3.8), had a mean educational level of 12.1 years (SD = 1.8), and had an average score of 49.5 on the WRAT (SD = 12.8; N = 23; WRAT scores were unavailable for three subjects). The sample was composed of 57.6% males and 42.4% females. Sixty-five percent of the sample was African-American, and 35% was Caucasian. All subjects received antipsychotic medication with an average daily dosage of chlorpromazine (CPZ) equivalent of 698 mg (SD = 513.65). The neuroleptic dosage level was unavailable for one subject, who was excluded from the computation of the average neuroleptic level for study participants.
