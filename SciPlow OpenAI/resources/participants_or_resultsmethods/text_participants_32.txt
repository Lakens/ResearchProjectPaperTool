Participants
Students in a large middle school (grades 7 and 8) in the Southeastern USA completed measures of life satisfaction and electronic bullying and electronic victimization as part of a larger survey of school climate administered and conducted by school personnel.
After accounting for absences and students whose parents refused permission to participate (n = 11), a total of 910 students were administered survey packets.
After eliminating incomplete surveys, a total of 855 (409 boys and 446 girls) students were included in the analyses.
This sample included 443 seventh-grade (214 boys and 229 girls) and 412 eighthgrade students (195 boys and 217 girls).
The mean age of participants was 13 (SD = .76 years).
A total of 59% of the participants were Caucasian, 28% were African American, 3% were Asian American or Pacific Islander, and 2.6% were Hispanic.
Approximately 22% of students reported receiving free or reduced lunch, which was used as an estimate of socio-economic status (SES).
Also, 62.5% of students reported that they lived with both their biological mother and father, while the remaining 37.5% reported living with other combinations of adults (i.e., mother and step-father, father and stepmother, or other adults).
Finally, 59.1% of students reported that their parents were married, 23.7% reported their parents were divorced, and the remaining 7.2% reported their parents were separated, never married, or widowed.
