Participants
Volunteers (N Ï­ 110) replied to study advertisements that were posted on e-mail flyers sent through e-mail lists of various professional contacts, Web sites (i.e., www.craigslist-.com), and Weblogs ("blogs").
Eighty-three participants (55 women, 28 men) were enrolled after screening for nine criteria.
To meet criteria for the study, participants (a) did not have a current (in the last 12 months), daily, active practice of cultivating sacred moments, but who had experienced them, either spontaneously or deliberately, in the past and/or present; (b) had self-reported current good or better health with no major surgeries or acute illnesses in the last 6 months; (c) had self-reported stable psychological health; (d) were willing to share sacred moment experiences and examine them at a deeper level; (e) were willing to write about sacred moment experiences; (f ) were willing and able to use a computer; (g) were willing to meet the time commitment of the study; (h) were fluent English-speaking adults, 18 years of age; and (i) were not currently pregnant, due to federal guidelines for research.
Of these, 9 dropped out for personal reasons and 1 was dropped due to pregnancy not previously reported.
Thus, 73 participants (49 women, 24 men) successfully completed the study.
Participants ranged in age from 18-54 years with majority falling between 22-44 years of age.
Fifty-six percent of participants came from a Judeo-Christian background, 15% considered themselves to be nondenominational, and the remainder came from a wide variety of backgrounds (e.g., Buddhist, Unitarian, Pagan, Hindu).
Seventyone percent were White, 11% were Chinese, and the remainder were from an array of different cultures (e.g., Indian, Israeli, Latino).
