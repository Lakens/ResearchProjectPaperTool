Method Results
Participants and procedure Participants were youth with an intellectual disability and/or developmental disorders who were visiting the Herman Broeren School, a school for special education students in the southern province in the Netherlands. The school enrolled 280 students. Students were selected if they had a total IQ level of at least 50 and were able to read the information in the questionnaire. Students who did not have sufficient reading abilities were excluded. A sample of 150 students fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Parents were sent a letter asking permission. Parents of 30 children did not give their permission and these children were excluded. Several children were excluded because of illness or absence. All participants were familiar with cellphones, internet and/or computers. A total of 114 students participated in this study, of whom most (82%) had an intellectual disability or borderline IQ (IQ < 85). IQ scores ranged from 52-118. Eighteen per cent of the participants had an average or above average IQ (total IQ between 85-118) and visited this school because of a developmental disorder and behaviour and emotional problems. Most adolescents (67%) had a diagnosis, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder among others. Most (i.e. 97%) students were born in The Netherlands. Participants were between 12-19 years old and there were more boys (72%) than girls (28%). Selection criteria was a total IQ of at least 50 because a certain reading level was required to complete the questionnaire (see below). Questionnaires (see Instrument) were completed in the students' classroom. During completion both the investigator and teacher were present in the classroom and students were informed about the topic of cyberbullying. They were told that the data would be assessed anonymously. Demographic information of each student was retrieved from his or her personal file. Cellphone Most students (i.e. 87%) owned a cellphone and most popular activities via cellphone were to make phone calls (70%) and send text messages (57%). In a minority of students (i.e. 12%), parents controlled their activities on the cellphone.
Questionnaire The questionnaire consisted of four parts. Each part contained several questions (open ended and closed). Questions and response options had been simplified by using language that the students were able to understand. . Part 1. The first part addressed sociodemographic variables (e.g. gender, age, IQ). . Part 2. The second part contained nine questions measuring self-esteem (e.g. 'I think positively about myself', 'I am not good at anything'). These questions were derived from the questionnaire developed by Scholte et al. [14]. Each item could be rated on a 3-point Likert-type scale, with options 'true', 'sometimes true' and 'not true'. A mean item score of self-esteem was calculated, provided that six of the nine questions were scored. . Part 3. This part contained questions on 12 depressive symptoms (e.g. 'I feel happy', 'I am tense and nervous', 'I worry about things'). Each item could be rated on a 3-point Likert scale, with options '(almost) never' (1), 'ometimes' (2) and 'often' (3). A mean item score was calculated provided that eight of the 12 questions had been endorsed by a student. . Part 4. The fifth and largest part of the questionnaire contained questions about the use of cellphones and internet and bullying via these media. Items address type and frequency of bullying and victimization via internet and cellphone and are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale: 'never' (1), 'once to five times' (2), 'once a month' (3), 'once a week' (4) and 'more times a week' (5). The items were scored for the last 3 months. A mean item score was calculated provided that four of the six questions had been scored by the respondents. Internet Almost all students had access to the internet at home (97%). Less than half of the sample (41%) had a computer in their own bedroom. According to students, 69% reported that their parents were unaware of the type of activities they engaged in when using the internet. Most students used the internet for Microsoft Network (MSN) (67%), downloading music (65%) and playing online games (57%), sending/receiving email (43%), downloading pictures and films (31%), looking for information for educational purposes (30%), using a web cam (28%), putting information about oneself on the internet (27%), chatting on a website (24%) and using skype (internet phone) (12%). Cyberbullying occurred less often and took the form of putting information about other students on the internet (5%), sending anonymous mails (4%), hacking someone's computer (4%) and sending a text message bomb via MSN (3%). Results depicted in Table II show that most students never bullied or were victimized via the internet during the last month. Percentages of students who were victimized at least once a week varied between 5-12%, depending on the form of victimization. Percentages of students who bullied at least once a week were somewhat lower and varied between 1-8%.
Bullies, victims, bullies/victims and uninvolved students For the purpose of these analyses related to cyberbullying via internet and cyberbullying via cellphone, this study distinguished between four groups of students: the first group consisted only of victims, the second group comprised only students who bullied, the third group consisted of students who were both bully and victim and the fourth group consisted of students who were neither a bully nor a victim. The last group consisted of students who were uninvolved, thus neither a bully nor a victim of cyberbullying. These groups were established on the basis of deviation of scores. Students were allocated to groups if they had at least a score of '3' (occurring once a month) for being a victim, bully, bully/victim and uninvolved. Prevalence of victims, bullies, victim/bullies and non-involved students Most students were not involved in bullying via the internet (i.e. 90%) and via cellphone (i.e. 86%). Percentages of students who were victimized, who bullied and who were both bully and victim via the internet were 7, 0 and 3, respectively. Four per cent of students were victimized via cellphone, 4% were bullies and 5% were both victimized and bullied via cellphone.
Method Cyberbullying via cellphone and internet There was a significant and large positive correlation (r ¼ 0.68, p < 0.01) between being a victim of cyberbullying via the internet and being an online bully. This means that most online bullies were also victims of this form of cyberbullying. There also was a positive correlation between being a victim of cyberbullying via cellphone and being a bully via cellphone (r ¼ 0.68, p < 0.01). The more students were a victim of bullying via the cellphone, the more they were also a bully using a cellphone. It may be concluded that among this sample of special education students, there is a particular group of students who are both a cyberbully and a victim of cyberbullying.
Participants and procedure Participants were youth with an intellectual disability and/or developmental disorders who were visiting the Herman Broeren School, a school for special education students in the southern province in the Netherlands. The school enrolled 280 students. Students were selected if they had a total IQ level of at least 50 and were able to read the information in the questionnaire.

Most adolescents (67%) had a diagnosis, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder among others. Most (i.e. 97%) students were born in The Netherlands. Participants were between 12-19 years old and there were more boys (72%) than girls (28%). Selection criteria was a total IQ of at least 50 because a certain reading level was required to complete the questionnaire (see below). Questionnaires (see Instrument) were completed in the students' classroom. During completion both the investigator and teacher were present in the classroom and students were informed about the topic of cyberbullying. They were told that the data would be assessed anonymously. Demographic information of each student was retrieved from his or her personal file. Associations between cyberbullying and other variables Age. No significant associations were found between cyberbullying via cellphone or the internet and age in years. IQ. There was a significant positive relationship between bullying via the internet and total IQ (r ¼ 0.25, p < 0.01) and verbal IQ (r ¼ 0.26, p < 0.01). The higher students' IQ, the more often they bullied via the internet. Gender. There were no significant differences in frequency in cyberbullying between boys and girls in terms of frequencies in which they were involved in bullying or were victimized via cellphone and the internet. ADHD and ASD. This study compared three groups on victimization and bullying via the internet and cellphone: (a) students with ADHD, (b) students with ASD and (c) control group. There were no significant differences between groups except for bullying via cellphone. Students with ADHD bullied more often via cellphone than students from the other groups, 2 (2) ¼ 8.91, p < 0.01. Self-esteem, depressive feelings. There was a negative correlation (r ¼ À0.35, p < 0.01) between being a victim of internet bullying and self-esteem and a positive correlation (r ¼ 0.37, p < 0.01) between being a victim of internet bullying and depressive feelings. That is, the more often a student was victimized via the internet the less self-esteem and the more depressive feelings s/he reported. A positive correlation (r ¼ 0.29, p < 0.01) was also found between bullying and depressive feelings: the more a students bullied via the internet the more depressive feelings they reported. Next, a negative correlation was found between victimization via cellphone and self-esteem. The more often a student reported to be victimized via a cellphone the lower his of her level of self-esteem (r ¼ À0.31, p < 0.01) and the higher his self-reported level of depressive feelings (r ¼ 0.19, p < 0.05). Finally, a negative correlation was found between bullying via cellphone and level of self-esteem (r ¼ À0.19, p < 0.05): the more students bullied via a cellphone, the lower their level of self-esteem. These results clearly indicate that there is a relationship between cyberbullying and emotional distress and psychological problems. Frequency of use of computer. Results from Mann-Whitney tests revealed that there was an association between frequency with which students used the computer and cyberbullying. Students who used their computer for less than 1 hour each day were less often victimized via the internet than students who used the computer for more than 1 hour per day, z ¼ 3.30, p < 0.001. Also, students who used their computer for more than 1 hour per day bullied more often via the internet than students who used their computer for less hours per day, z ¼ À3.06, p < 0.001. So the duration of computer usage may be seen as a risk factor for being victimized and/or bullying via the internet.
