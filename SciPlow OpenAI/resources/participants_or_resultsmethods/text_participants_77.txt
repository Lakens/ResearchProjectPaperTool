Participants
Participants in the study were 56 healthy controls and 48 schizophrenia outpatients.
Healthy controls were recruited from the community for single-session assessments of affect recognition and met the following inclusion criteria: no Axis I psychiatric diagnosis, aged 18-65, no visual or auditory impairment that would interfere with study procedures, and no documented mental retardation.
Schizophrenia patients were recruited as part of an ongoing study of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia at VA Connecticut Healthcare System and met the following inclusion criteria: Axis I diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, aged 18-65, no current substance dependence, psychiatric stability as evidenced by no medication changes and no housing changes in past 30 days.
All diagnostic interviews were performed by the first author using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID; First et al., 1996).
For the current analyses, affect recognition data from healthy community controls were only used to establish guidelines for what constitutes normal-range performance.
All other analyses were performed only for the schizophrenia sample, using baseline affect recognition, neurocognition and functioning data.
The local Institutional Review Boards approved study protocols, and all participants signed written informed consent.
