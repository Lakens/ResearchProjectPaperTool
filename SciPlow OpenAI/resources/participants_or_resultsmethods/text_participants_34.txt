Participants
There were 3004 12-year-old to 16-year-old students, with 1009 girls (33.6% of the sample) and 1995 boys (66.4% of the sample).
The students represented the entire student body of the first, second, third and fourth years from nine post-primary schools.
The schools were selected on the basis of reflecting nationwide trends in school characteristics across six measures: fee paying/nonfee-paying; type (there are four types of post-primary education establishments in Ireland); gender of pupils (boys only, girls only, co-educational); designated as serving an area of disadvantage, or otherwise; size (i.e. number of pupils enrolled); and geographical location, according to the most recent governmental statistics available (Post-Primary School Listings, 2006/07).
