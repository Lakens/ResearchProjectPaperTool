Participants
Patients who had been diagnosed with prostate or gynecological cancer within the past 5 years were recruited through clinics in the Chicago and Milwaukee metropolitan areas for a broader ongoing longitudinal study examining the psychosocial effects of emotional disclosure.
Eligibility requirements included a first-time diagnosis of prostate or gynecological cancer, completion of active cancer treatment, no evidence of psychiatric problems or any current life-threatening disease other than cancer, and ability to fluently read and write in English.
Of the patients who were initially screened for the study, 27% declined participation.
The most frequently cited reasons were lack of interest or time (84%), being too ill (12%), and dealing with other problems (4%).
Of the 127 patients who agreed to participate, 17 dropped out of the study after the baseline assessment (control group: n ϭ 8; experimental group: n ϭ 9), and 6 did so after completing the writing (control group: n ϭ 3; experimental group: n ϭ 3).
The final sample of 104 patients who completed all of the assessments necessary for the present analyses had been recruited over the course of 2 years.
Patients were between 25 and 84 years of age (M ϭ 59.75, SD ϭ 11.09); 51.9% were female, 95.2% were Caucasian, 79.8% were married, 51% were employed, and 46.2% had at least a college education.
Types of cancer included prostate carcinoma (48.1%), uterine (18.3%), ovarian (13.5%), cervical (11.5), and other (4.9%); 3.8% of the patients had more than one type of cancer.
Gleason scores, available for 40 of the prostate cancer patients, ranged from 3 to 8; the majority of these patients presented at Gleason Stage 6 (44%).
Stages were available for 41 gynecological cancer patients; these patients ranged from Stage I to Stage IV, with the majority presenting at Stage I (43%).
Time since cancer diagnosis ranged from 0.14 to 4.96 years (M ϭ 1.43, SD ϭ 1.21), and 85.6% of patients had undergone surgery to treat their cancer (see Table 1 for data on demographic and medical variables by experimental condition).
