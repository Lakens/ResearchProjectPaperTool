Methods This study was approved by the St Vincent's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/13/SVH/291). The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials registry (ACTRN12613001198718). Results
Design Study details are reported in the published protocol [24]. Eligible participants were randomly allocated to the iCBT program or the TAU group who received the intervention after a 10-week waiting period. Simple randomization was used (1:1 ratio), and randomization numbers were generated by an independent research assistant using random.org. Group allocation was concealed in sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. All participants provided electronic informed consent before participating. Participant Flow Of the 334 individuals who started a Web-based application, 185 were eligible for phone interview. After phone interview, 106 individuals met the inclusion criteria and were randomized to either iCBT (n=49) or TAU (n=57). Of these participants, 42/49 allocated to the iCBT group and 49/57 allocated to the TAU group completed baseline assessment and were included in the ITT analysis. At posttreatment assessment, 31/49 provided data in the iCBT group and 46/49 provided data in the TAU group. At 3-month follow-up, 21 participants completed the questionnaires and 31 completed the diagnostic interview to assess MDD. See Figure 1 for study flow diagram.
Eligibility Inclusion criteria included: Australian resident, age 18 years or older, fluent in English, access to a computer and Internet, self-reported diagnosis of T1 or T2 DM, meet criteria for MDD according to telephone-administered diagnostic interview, and provide personal and general practitioner (GP) contact details. Participants were excluded if they had a self-reported diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder, psychotic disorder or substance use disorder, or were taking antipsychotics or benzodiazepines. Participants were excluded if they had commenced CBT in the past month, or changed antidepressant medication in the past 2 months. Participants scoring either <5 (normal range) or >23 (very severe) on the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were excluded, and those identified as being at significant risk of suicide or deliberate self-harm in the telephone risk assessment were also excluded and referred to appropriate treatments. Baseline Characteristics A total of 52 participants (57% of the sample) had T1 DM. Participants were 47 years on average (SD 12.61, range 20-71), and the majority were female (71%, 64/90) and married or living in a defacto relationship (55/90, 61%). Education status was mixed: one-fifth (16/90, 18%) had not completed high school, whereas 29 completed tertiary education (32%, 29/90). The majority were in full-time or part-time paid work (50/90, 56%), with 12 on the disability support pension (12/90, 6%). Only 16% (14/90) of the total sample were receiving psychological therapy, and 40% were taking medications for depression at baseline (37/90, 41%; see Table 1 for sample characteristics). Participants' baseline depression levels were moderate to severe on the PHQ-9 (mean 15.0, SD 5.3). The majority reported 3 or more episodes of depression (80/90, 89%); two-thirds of the sample had not been depression free for at least 2 years (57/90, 63%), and half (46/90, 51%) reported being depressed for more than 4 years during their lifetime. Almost three quarters of the sample (65/90, 72%) reported chronic disease comorbidities, with the average being 1.25 comorbid conditions (SD 1.07, range 0-4). Circulatory conditions were the most common (43/90, 48%), followed by arthritis conditions (30/90, 37%). It was found that 40% of the sample (n=37) reported having at least one DM-related complication, with eyesight problems the most common (n=14 individuals (16%, 14/90) followed by nerve damage (10/90, 11%).
Setting and Procedure Participants were recruited from September 2013 to June 2015 by advertisements on DM websites, social media, and fliers. Interested applicants applied on the Web via the St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney's Virtual Clinic website, with an email and username, and completed Web-based screening questionnaires. Those who passed the Web-based screening criteria were assessed via telephone to confirm whether they met DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria [25] for MDD according to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Version 5.0.0 [26]. There were no face-to-face components of the study. Baseline Between-Group Comparisons There were no significant differences between the groups on baseline scores, the self-report measures (PHQ-9, PAID, K-10), and demographic variables (eg, DM type, gender, education, employment, depression onset, comorbid chronic conditions). The TAU group were older on average than the iCBT group (t 88 =2.22, P=.029).
Interventions Adherence It was found that 27 out of 41 individuals in the iCBT group completed all 6 lessons of the program, resulting in a 66% adherence rate. Of the noncompleters, 4 participants completed 1 lesson only, 3 completed 2 lessons, 2 completed 4 lessons, and 3 completed 5 lessons.
Internet Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) The iCBT Program is described in detail elsewhere [24,27] and a demo can be accessed by contacting the corresponding author. In brief, participants completed 6 automated cartoon-style Web-based lessons teaching CBT skills (eg, behavioral activation) over 10 weeks, with a minimum wait-time of 5 days between lessons. Participants downloaded a "homework" document which included practical assignments (eg, thought monitoring) after each lesson, and had access to extra resources, frequently asked questions, and recovery stories of former participants. Automated reminder emails were also sent to participants when lessons became available. Participants in the iCBT group were able to continue to receive usual care from their health services during the intervention period. Expectancy of Benefit Prior to lesson 1, participants in the iCBT group were asked to provide a rating ranging from 1 to 9 about how logical the therapy offered to them seemed (where 1=not at all, 9=very logical), and how useful they thought the treatment would be in reducing their symptoms of depression (where 1=not at all, 9=very useful). The scores on these items were summed to derive an "expectancy of benefit" rating. On average, scores in the treatment group were positive (mean 11.27, SD 3.89, range 2-18).
Treatment as Usual (TAU) Control Group Participants in the TAU control condition waited 10 weeks to gain access to the iCBT program. During the waiting period, they were able to continue to receive usual care from their health services. Primary Outcome Measures at Posttreatment and Effect Sizes
Clinician-Guidance Minimal clinician-assistance was provided to encourage adherence and engagement with the program by trained clinical psychologists with either Masters (LR) or PhD-level (JN) qualifications or psychiatry registrars (TM). Clinicians contacted the patient after lesson 1 and lesson 2 by email or phone to encourage progress. During the remainder of the program, clinician contact was made primarily by email, but if clinically indicated, or if patients' Kessler 10-item psychological distress scale (K-10) or PHQ-9 scores deteriorated significantly, telephone contact was made by the clinician. Within-Group Effect Sizes (Baseline to Posttreatment) Within-group comparisons for the iCBT group revealed large effect sizes between pretreatment and posttreatment on the PHQ-9 (d=1.90), PAID (d=1.18), K-10 (d=2.59), SF-12 mental well-being subscale (d=-0.85), and GAD-7 (d=1.38, 95% CI 0.86-1.90), and moderate for somatic symptom severity on the PHQ-15 (d=0.63). The changes on the SF12 physical well-being subscale and HbA1c levels were not significant (P>.05, see Table 2). The TAU group demonstrated medium statistically significant reductions in PHQ-9 (d=0.53), GAD-7 (d=0.42), and the K-10 (d=0.41), although the changes on the remaining outcome measures were not significant.
Power Calculations With a sample size of 40 participants per group, the study was powered (0.8 power) to detect a medium between-group difference of 0.65 on the primary depression measure at posttreatment (Cronbach alpha set at .05). Between-Group Effect Sizes (Posttreatment) Posttreatment scores were significantly lower in the iCBT group relative to TAU on the PHQ-9, PAID, K-10, GAD-7, and SF-12 mental well-being subscales with moderate between-groups effect sizes on the PHQ-9 (g=0.78, 95% CI 0.30-1.25), GAD-7 scores (g=0.72, 95% CI 0.25-1. 19), and SF-12 MCS scores (g=-0.66, 95% CI -1.12 to -0.19). In addition, we found large between-group differences for PAID scores (g=0.80, 95% CI 0.32-1.27) and K-10 (g=1.06, 95% CI 0.57-1.54). The between-group effect sizes for the other measures were small and not-significant (PHQ-15: g=0.21, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.67; HbA1c levels: g= -0.14, 95% CI -0.62 to 0.34; SF-12 PCS: g=0.15, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.60).
Statistical Analyses All analyses were undertaken in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 (IBM Corp, 2014). ITT linear mixed models analyses were used to account for missing data due to participant dropouts. This approach is appropriate for RCTs with multiple time points [28] and does not assume that the last measurement was stable (an assumption of the the last observation carried forward approach [29]). Linear mixed models were conducted separately for each of the dependent variable (DV) measures, with time, treatment group, and the time by group interaction entered as fixed factors in the model, with a random intercept for subject. For each outcome, an identity covariance structure was specified to model the covariance structure of the random intercept. Initial model building focused on the selection of the most appropriate covariance structure for the residual correlation matrix. Model fit indices and inspection of the variance-covariance matrix supported the selection of the identity covariance structure for each of the outcome measures. The fixed effect of age was added to each of the models. For each outcome measure except for problem areas in diabetes (PAID) scores, the fixed effect of age was not statistically significant and was removed from the model. Chi-square difference testing of the -2 log-likelihoods indicated that the removal of these fixed effects did not decrease model fit for any of the outcome variables, and they were excluded from further analyses. For each group, planned contrasts were used to compare changes within and between groups from baseline to posttreatment (and 3-month follow-up for the iCBT group only). Between-group effect sizes using the pooled standard deviation and adjusted for sample size (Hedges g) were calculated to compare between groups at posttreatment. Within-group effect sizes (Cohen d) were calculated between pre-and posttreatment for both groups, and between pre-and 3-month follow-up for the iCBT group only. Effect sizes of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 were considered to be small, moderate, and large respectively in line with Cohen recommendations [30]. To investigate whether there were changes between posttreatment and follow-up for the iCBT group (n=21) for each dependent variable (eg, PHQ-9 scores), linear mixed models were conducted with time entered as a fixed factor and subject as a random intercept. Reliable Change Of the iCBT group, 21/31 (51%) reliably improved compared with 9 (18%) in the TAU group. Of the iCBT group, no participants evidenced reliable deterioration, compared with only 2 participants in the TAU group (4%). The difference in proportions of participants who evidenced reliable change was significant (χ 2 2 =18.4, P<.001). There were no significant differences between iCBT participants who showed reliable change versus those who did not show reliable change on any of the clinical or demographic variables at baseline (t=0.46-1.79, P>.08).
Reliable Change Reliable change index (RCI) values [31] were calculated for the PHQ-9 scores to determine the proportion of each group who evidenced reliable improvements (or deterioration) between baseline and posttreatment RCI values were calculated using test-retest reliability values of .84 from Kroenke et al (2001). In order to calculate standard error of measurement values, standard deviations were derived from current sample (PHQ-9 pretreatment pooled, SD 5.34). We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals in the iCBT group who were considered responders (reliable improvements in PHQ-9 scores) and nonresponders (no reliable change in PHQ-9 scores) using independent-samples t tests and chi-square for categorical data. Completers Versus Noncompleters in the Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) Group We compared baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants who completed all 6 lessons versus those who completed fewer than 6 lessons to explore whether there were any key differences at baseline in completers versus noncompleters. There were no significant differences on any of the clinical or demographic variables, including expectancy ratings at baseline. However, there was a trend toward higher K-10 distress scores in completers compared with noncompleters (K-10: completer sample (n=21): mean 31.96, SD 5.61, noncompleter sample (n=14): mean 28.36, SD 5.98, t 39 =1.91, P=.06, g=0.61, 95% CI 0.08-1.30).
Completers Versus Noncompleters We also sought to compare the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals in the iCBT group who completed the entire program versus those who did not complete the program, using independent-samples t test and chi-square for categorical data. Outcomes for iCBT Group Between Posttreatment and 3-Months Follow-Up There were no statistically significant effects of time for any of the outcome measures between posttreatment and follow-up (n=19). The within-group effect sizes were small and not significant (see Table 3).
Measurements All measures were Web-based self-report questionnaires, with the exception of the MINI diagnostic interview which was administered by telephone. Diagnostic Status at Follow-Up Of the total 31 participants in the iCBT group who completed a diagnostic interview to assess for MDD, 27 (87.1%) no longer met criteria for MDD.
Baseline Measures At baseline, sociodemographic and sample characteristics were assessed including DM-and depression-related illness and treatment history. Clinician Time The clinician spent on average 27.3 min per participant on email and telephone contact in the iCBT group (SD 14.9, range 8-71 min) over the course of the program. The clinician spent on average 13.51 min (SD 13.74, range 1-69 min) on the control group. This difference was significant (t 88 =4.55, P<.001).
Primary Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure was the PHQ-9 [32], which is a validated 9-item self-report measure of depression symptom severity over the past 2 weeks. The PHQ-9 contains items answered on a 4-point Likert scale; the total score ranges between 0 and 27 [33]. The PHQ-9 has been validated in diabetes samples [34]. Glycemic control was measured via self-reported HbA1c values. Diabetes-related distress was measured using the PAID [35] questionnaire, a well-validated 20-item measure with a 5-point Likert scale; total scores are multiplied by 1.25 and range from 0 to 100 (with higher scores indicating greater emotional distress). The PAID has demonstrated sensitivity to change [36] and good internal and test-retest reliability [35]. Patient Satisfaction The iCBT participants were asked to provide a rating about: (1) how satisfied they were that the program taught them the skills to manage depression and (2) their confidence in recommending the program to a friend with similar problems (where 1=not at all, 5=somewhat, and 9=very). The overall mean scores were acceptable (satisfaction: mean 6.06, SD 2.14; recommend to friend (mean 6.84, SD 2.20, range 1-9). The majority of participants reported feeling somewhat to very satisfied with the program (n=27; 85%), although only 3 of these (9% of the sample collected at posttreatment) were "very" satisfied. The majority of participants reported feeling somewhat to very confident in recommending the program to a friend (n=28; 88%); of these 9 (28%) reported feeling very confident in recommending this program to a friend.
Secondary Outcome Measures The secondary outcome measures included the K-10 [37] for psychological distress; short form 12-item (SF-12) scale to measure of mental well-being (SF-12 MCS) and physical well-being (SF-12 PCS) [38], the generalized anxiety disorder 7-item (GAD-7) [39] for anxiety severity; and the PHQ-15-physical symptoms module for somatic symptom severity [40]. Other measures were also administered as part of the trial, which will be reported elsewhere. These include the relationships questionnaire (to assess attachment style), the alcohol and eating modules of the PHQ, and the fantastic checklist to assess specific lifestyle behaviours such as smoking status and alcohol use. Results
Treatment Expectancy, Acceptability, and Satisfaction Participants rated their expectancy of benefit from the intervention at baseline, and the acceptability and satisfaction with the program at posttreatment using the treatment credibility or expectancy questionnaire (CEQ) [41]. Participant Flow Of the 334 individuals who started a Web-based application, 185 were eligible for phone interview. After phone interview, 106 individuals met the inclusion criteria and were randomized to either iCBT (n=49) or TAU (n=57). Of these participants, 42/49 allocated to the iCBT group and 49/57 allocated to the TAU group completed baseline assessment and were included in the ITT analysis. At posttreatment assessment, 31/49 provided data in the iCBT group and 46/49 provided data in the TAU group. At 3-month follow-up, 21 participants completed the questionnaires and 31 completed the diagnostic interview to assess MDD. See Figure 1 for study flow diagram.
Diagnostic Status Current DSM-IV MDD diagnosis was assessed with the MINI version 5.0.0 [26] at baseline for both groups, and 3-month follow-up for the iCBT group only. The MINI possesses excellent interrater reliability (k=0.88-1.00) and good concurrent validity with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, World Health Organization, 1990) [42]. Baseline Characteristics A total of 52 participants (57% of the sample) had T1 DM. Participants were 47 years on average (SD 12.61, range 20-71), and the majority were female (71%, 64/90) and married or living in a defacto relationship (55/90, 61%). Education status was mixed: one-fifth (16/90, 18%) had not completed high school, whereas 29 completed tertiary education (32%, 29/90). The majority were in full-time or part-time paid work (50/90, 56%), with 12 on the disability support pension (12/90, 6%). Only 16% (14/90) of the total sample were receiving psychological therapy, and 40% were taking medications for depression at baseline (37/90, 41%; see Table 1 for sample characteristics). Participants' baseline depression levels were moderate to severe on the PHQ-9 (mean 15.0, SD 5.3). The majority reported 3 or more episodes of depression (80/90, 89%); two-thirds of the sample had not been depression free for at least 2 years (57/90, 63%), and half (46/90, 51%) reported being depressed for more than 4 years during their lifetime. Almost three quarters of the sample (65/90, 72%) reported chronic disease comorbidities, with the average being 1.25 comorbid conditions (SD 1.07, range 0-4). Circulatory conditions were the most common (43/90, 48%), followed by arthritis conditions (30/90, 37%). It was found that 40% of the sample (n=37) reported having at least one DM-related complication, with eyesight problems the most common (n=14 individuals (16%, 14/90) followed by nerve damage (10/90, 11%).
Measurement Time-Points Outcomes were assessed at 3 time points: baseline, posttreatment (11 weeks), and 3-month follow-up (for the iCBT group only, as the TAU group received the iCBT program after they completed the posttreatment assessment). The primary outcome measures (PHQ-9, PAID) were also administered at the mid-time point (5 weeks). Finally, the K-10 was administered prior to each lesson in the iCBT group to monitor distress. Baseline Between-Group Comparisons There were no significant differences between the groups on baseline scores, the self-report measures (PHQ-9, PAID, K-10), and demographic variables (eg, DM type, gender, education, employment, depression onset, comorbid chronic conditions). The TAU group were older on average than the iCBT group (t 88 =2.22, P=.029).
