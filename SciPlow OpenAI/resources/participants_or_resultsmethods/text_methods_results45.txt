PATIENTS AND METHODS Study design. Based on our previous results (30), we calculated that a sample size of 25 per group would be needed to detect a between-group difference of 0.8 at posttreatment on the primary outcomes. Participants were recruited from February to October 2014 from 4 Australian health care organizations. The trial was approved by St. Vincent's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (Sydney, Australia), and participants provided electronic informed consent. Participants were included if they were ages ≥50 years, had a self-reported diagnosis of symptomatic knee OA based on radiographic criteria and knee pain on most days (in line with American College of Rheumatology knee OA classification criteria [31]), met criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the clinician-administered Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), were fluent in English, and had access to a computer with the internet. Participants were excluded if they met criteria for bipolar, psychotic, or substance dependence disorders, were taking antipsychotics or benzodiazepines, were not on a stable dose of antidepressant medication for at least 2 months, were currently suicidal based on both self-report and diagnostic interview, or were currently receiving CBT for depression. Procedures. Applicants completed online screening questionnaires via the research web site of the Clinic Research Unit for Anxiety and Depression (www.virtualclinic.org.au). Eligible participants were telephoned to determine whether they met diagnostic criteria for MDD, and if criteria were met, participants were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups: OA treatment as usual + iCBT for MDD (iCBT group), or the OA TAU control group who received the standard treatment they would receive for OA if they were not participating in the trial. Participants were allocated by simple randomization (1:1 allocation ratio) without any restrictions placed on the sequence (no stratification or blocking was used). Randomization was completed by an independent researcher not involved in the study, and group allocation was concealed in sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. All participants were offered 1 entry into a gift-card drawing following completion of the study. Interventions. The iCBT Sadness Program consists of 6 online lessons representing best practice CBT, as well as regular homework assignments and access to supplementary resources. The Sadness Program has been validated in a number of clinical efficacy and effectiveness trials (28,(32)(33)(34)(35). Each lesson comprises a cartoon narrative in which a character gains mastery over MDD symptoms by learning and implementing CBT skills. Patient queries throughout the program were primarily addressed by e-mail contact. If patients' Kessler-10 (K-10) and/or 9-Item Patient Health RESULTS Baseline characteristics. The mean AE SD age of participants (see Table T1 1 for sample characteristics) was 62 AE 7.07 years (range 50-81 years), and the majority were female (n = 55, 80%). Participants reported moderate levels of depression on the PHQ-9 at baseline, with 40% indicating antidepressant medications use (n = 28, 59%). Participants' mean AE SD age of onset of depression was 31.24 AE 17.89 years (range 5-75 years), and the majority had a recurrent history with 57 (82.6%) reporting 3 or more previous episodes. Expectancy of benefit and baseline between-group comparisons. Scores on the "expectancy to benefit" measure in the iCBT group were positive (mean AE SD 11.57 AE 3.79 years, range 4-18 years). There were no significant differences between the groups on pretreatment PHQ-9 or K-10 scores. Chi-square analyses indicated no between-group differences in any demographic characteristics (sex, marital status, educational status, employment status, or mean age at onset of depression; P > 0.05), with the exception of age. Participants in the iCBT group were older (mean AE SD age 63.16 AE 7.38 years) than the TAU group (mean AE SD age 59.68 AE 6.01 years; t(67) = 2.01, P = 0.049). Adherence. Of the 44 participants in the iCBT group, 37 participants completed all 6 lessons (84% adherence). Of the 44 participants, 42 completed posttreatment and 3-month assessments. Of the 25 participants in the TAU group who were eligible for analysis, 23 provided complete posttreatment data, and 24 provided followup data (see Figure F1 1 for participant flow). There was no evidence of group or baseline severity as predictors of dropout in logistic regressions conducted at either time point (posttreatment or 3-month followup). We also carried out Little's Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) test, which was not statistically significant, suggesting that the data were missing at random (Little's MCAR: v 2 = 0.57, 2 df; P = 0.75). Primary outcome measures and effect sizes. Age was entered as a covariate in all analyses because there was a significant difference between the groups at baseline (P = 0.049). Results and effect sizes are reported in Table T2 2. There were significant group by time interactions for the primary outcome measures (PHQ-9: F [3,191.03] = 9.82, P < 0.001 and K-10: F [3,190.06] = 6.37, P < 0.001). Posttreatment scores were significantly lower in the iCBT group relative to TAU on the primary outcomes, with a large between-group effect size for PHQ-9 scores (Hedges g = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.47, 1.54) and a medium effect size for the K-10 (Hedges g = 0.75, 95% CI 0.23, 1.28). Between-group comparisons revealed that 3-month followup scores were significantly lower in the iCBT group relative to TAU, with large between-group effect sizes for both the PHQ-9 (Hedges g = 0.90, 95% CI 0.36, 1.44) and K-10 (Hedges g = 0.94, 95% CI 0.41, 1.48). Within-group contrasts in the iCBT group demonstrated large effect size reductions in depression and distress from pretreatment to posttreatment, and from pretreatment to 3-month followup (Table 2 andFigure F2 2).
Significance & Innovations • Approximately 1 in 5 adults with osteoarthritis (OA) experience depressed mood. Comorbid depression is associated with increased use of pain medication, reduced treatment benefits, higher health care utilization, and increased burden in OA patients. • Significant barriers prevent access to evidence- based mental health care. • This trial indicates that remotely accessible (internet-delivered) cognitive-behavioral therapy is acceptable and efficacious for older patients with depression and OA. • The benefits extend beyond reduced depressive symptoms, distress, and mental well-being to include improved arthritis-related self-efficacy, pain, stiffness, and physical function. Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores deteriorated significantly, telephone contact was made by a clinical psychologist. Outcome measurements. Primary outcomes included self-reported depression severity according to the PHQ-9 (36) and general psychological distress according to the K-10 (37). Secondary outcomes included functional health and well-being measured by the physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) health component summary scores of the 12-Item Short Form health survey (SF-12) (38), self-efficacy measured by the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) (39), and OA-specific pain, stiffness, and physical function according to the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) (40). MDD diagnostic status was assessed according to the MINI, version 5.0 (41). At baseline, participants reported on demographic details, medication use, and OA history. All participants completed the PHQ-9 and K-10 at baseline, week 5, week 11 (1 week following iCBT, postintervention end point), and 3-month followup (week 24). The ASES, WOMAC, and SF-12 were administered at baseline, week 11, and 3-month followup. iCBT participants additionally provided a rating about how logical the therapy seemed (where 1 = not at all and 9 = very logical), and how useful they thought the treatment would be in reducing their symptoms of depression (where 1 = not at all and 9 = very useful). Scores on these items were summed to derive a baseline "expectancy of benefit" rating. iCBT group participants completed the K-10 prior to each lesson, and adherence to the lessons was measured. iCBT group participants were asked 1) how satisfied they were that the program taught them the skills to manage depression, and 2) their confidence level in recommending the program to a friend with similar problems (where 1 = not at all, 5 = somewhat, and 9 = very). To assess diagnostic status at 3-month followup, a clinical psychologist blinded to treatment group administered the MINI (41). Additional measures (not reported here) included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7, Pain Detect Questionnaire, and Pain Catastrophizing Scale. Statistical analyses. Groups were compared at baseline using t-tests and chi-square analyses where the data consisted of categorical data. Intent-to-treat linear mixed models (accounting for missing data) were conducted for each of the dependent variables, with time, treatment group, and the time by group interaction entered as fixed factors in the model. Planned contrasts compared changes within and between groups from baseline to posttreatment (week 11) and 3-month followup (week 24). Between-group effect sizes using the pooled SD and adjusted for sample size (Hedges g) were calculated to compare between groups at posttreatment and 3-month followup. Within-group effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated between pre-and posttreatment and between pre-and 3-month followup for each group. Reliable change index values, using test-retest reliability values of 0.84 (36), were calculated for the PHQ-9 scores to determine the proportion of each group who evidenced reliable improvements (or deterioration) between baseline and followup (42). To calculate SE of measurement values, SDs were derived from the current sample (PHQ-9 pretreatment pooled SD: 4.79). iCBT for Depression in Older Adults With OA The reductions in the TAU group were small and not significant, with the exception of a moderate reduction in K-10 scores from pretreatment to followup (d = 0.67, 95% CI 0.09, 1.26). Secondary outcome measures and effect sizes. With the exception of SF-12 PCS scores (F[2,110.66] = 0.17, P > 0.05), there were significant group by time interactions for all remaining secondary outcome measures (ASES: F Posttreatment scores on the SF-12 MCS were significantly higher (reflecting better mental health) in the iCBT group relative to TAU (Hedges g = 0.70, 95% CI 0.20, 1.21). There were no significant differences between groups at posttreatment on the WOMAC, ASES, or SF-12 PCS scores (Table 2). Between-group comparisons of 3-month followup scores revealed that, relative to the TAU group, the iCBT group had significantly improved scores on all of the measures except for SF-12 PCS scores, which were small and not significant (Hedges g = 0.10, 95% CI À0.40, 0.61). Large between-group effect sizes were found for ASES (Hedges g = À0.81, 95% CI À0.29, À1.33) and SF-12 MCS scores (Hedges g = 0.87, 95% CI 0.34, 1.40), and moderate between-group effect sizes were found for the remaining variables (Hedges g = 0.56-0.65, 95% CI 0.04, 1.18) (Table 2). Within-group contrasts demonstrated a large improvement in mental health scores in the iCBT group from pretreatment to posttreatment (SF-12 MCS: d = À1.50, 95% CI À1.98, À1.02) and moderate to large effect size improvements for all measures from pretreatment to followup (d = 0.69-1.68, 95% CI 0.25, 2.17), with the exception of physical health scores (SF-12 PCS: d < 0.05). See Table 2 for additional nonsignificant results in the TAU group. Diagnostic status at followup and clinical significance at 3-month followup. In the iCBT group, 33 participants (84.6%) no longer met criteria for MDD versus 11 participants (50%) at followup in the TAU group. The proportion of recovered patients in the iCBT group was significantly higher than TAU (v 2 [1,61] = 8.38, P < 0.01). Of the iCBT group, 21 (47.7%) reliably improved compared to 3 (12.0%) in the TAU group. Of the iCBT group, only 1 (2.3%) evidenced deterioration on the PHQ-9, and 2 participants in the TAU group (8.0%) evidenced reliable deterioration. Regarding patient satisfaction, the majority of participants reported feeling somewhat to very satisfied with the program (n = 40, 95%) and somewhat to very confident in recommending the program to a friend (n = 39, 93%).
